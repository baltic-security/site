[{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"Introduction Since 1945, the topic of nuclear armaments has been on every country’s radar, shaping global geopolitics, defense strategies, and nuclear deterrence. In 2025, post-Soviet countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, still face tension with Russia’s imperialism, making the role of nuclear deterrence critical for European regional security and international security. In this context, I, as an American International Affairs student studying security policy, can offer a unique perspective into this critical topic. By exploring the current and past historical, geopolitical, and strategic dimensions of nuclear deterrence in the region, this piece will highlight Poland and the Baltics’ delicate position and the critical role they play within NATO’s defense framework. It will also shed some light on possible non-nuclear alternatives and NATO policy recommendations for a secure future for the region.\nHistorical Context Throughout the Cold War, Eastern Europe played a central role in the political struggle between the NATO alliance and the Soviet Union. Poland, while not part of the Soviet Union, was a member of the Warsaw Pact, hosting significant Soviet military infrastructure, acting as a buffer zone for the Soviet Union. While most of the Soviet Union’s nuclear arsenal was within the Soviet Union itself, Poland’s military infrastructure was vital to the Soviet Union nuclear strategy. On the other hand, the Baltic states, which are Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were completely engulfed by the Soviet Union, contributing to the Soviet Union’s Iron Curtain.\nThe nuclear deterrence strategy of NATO during the Cold War was based around the principle of collective defense, outlined in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The NATO alliance maintained a strict nuclear stance to deter Soviet and Warsaw Pact aggression, placing U.S. nuclear weapons all across Western Europe to counter the Warsaw Pact’s nuclear and conventional capabilities. This strategy was built around the idea of maintaining the balance of power and preventing a Soviet advantage. (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 2020)\nThe end of the Cold War, in 1991, completely changed geopolitics in Europe and the post-Soviet region. The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to the independence and democratization of the Baltic states, who eventually joined NATO in 2004. Prior to 2004, in 1999, Poland became a member of NATO, a complete 180 in its security interests. These security developments extended NATO’s influence eastward, closer to Russia, which has come with benefits and drawbacks. Recent actions by Russia, threatened by NATO, include the deployment of nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in the Kaliningrad region in 2018, and the deployment of additional nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Minsk, Belarus, in 2023. (Reuters, 2018) These recent security developments have raised concerns for NATO, especially Poland and the Baltics, creating a whole new set of complexities that NATO must navigate. (Karach, 2024)\nCurrent Geopolitical Landscape In 2014, the annexation of Crimea by Russia marked a change in geopolitics, with an impact we still see today, leading to increased tensions with NATO reevaluating its defense strategies. In response to Russia’s imperialism of Crimea, NATO established the Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in 2016, deploying NATO forces to the Baltics and Poland. The purpose of this program was to deter Russia’s aggression through visible and persistent military presence. (Palavenis, 2024)\nRecent evolutions in the security landscape was marked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This conflict not only highlighted Moscow’s willingness to use full military force to achieve its geopolitical goals, but also involved overt and explicit threats of nuclear escalation, a threat that shakes the world. Russian officials, alongside Vladimir Putin, issued statements that the use of nuclear weapons are justified if certain “red lines” were crossed. Such “red lines” include the involvement of a nuclear-armed state, such as the United States and NATO, in backing a non-nuclear state engaging in conflicts near Russia’s borders. (Williams, Hartigan, MacKenzie, \u0026amp; Younis, 2024)\nIn response to these escalations, Poland and the Baltic states have escalated their integration within NATO’s defense framework. Poland has passionately advocated for increased NATO troop deployments and has expressed interest in hosting nuclear armaments under NATO’s nuclear-sharing agreements. The Baltic states have welcomed and advocated for NATO’s presence, viewing the security alliance essential to their national security and sovereignty. The “eFP” forces stationed in these countries serve as a reassurance and commitment to NATO’s oath to collective defense. (Kepe, 2024)\nThe United States has played a critical role in shaping the nuclear security framework of the region. The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), launched in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, significantly increased U.S. defense spending in Eastern Europe. The increases in U.S. defense spending have prioritized infrastructure upgrades of Poland’s air bases, allowing for rapid deployment of NATO forces, if a crisis ever occurs. The program has also allocated funding for prepositioned equipment, such as tanks and heavy artillery, enhancing NATO readiness. Additionally, joint exercises like Defender Europe have enhanced interoperability between NATO and non-NATO allies. (United States Government Accountability Office, 2023)\nThis era of escalation since 2014 has been marked by several critical escalations and countermeasures that have fundamentally altered the security landscape of Eastern Europe for decades to come. Russia’s imperial actions and reckless nuclear threats was followed by a robust posturing of NATO and its member states, emphasizing a renewed efforts on deterrence in the region. The American Perspective\nFor many decades now, the United States has viewed Poland and the Baltic states as pivotal allies to NATO’s eastern defense. This is evident through the U.S. military investments and strategic initiatives in recent years, intended to reinforce regional security. Over the past five years, the United States has provided more than $34 million in security assistance to Poland, investing in their military mobility and awareness of potential threats. (Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, 2025) In addition to that, in 2024, the U.S. approved $228 million in military assistance to the Baltic states, investing in their air defense, Baltic Sea maritime awareness, and enhancement of land forces. (Le Monde, 2024)\nAlthough the United States hasn’t publicly confirmed nor supported plans to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland or the Baltic states, there has been persisting debates about enhancing NATO’s deterrence posture in Eastern Europe, especially after Russia’s belligerent and reckless threats of the use of nuclear weapons. The platform known as “War on the Rocks” goes into great detail about making nuclear-sharing more credible and the approaches to nuclear-sharing in Europe. A practical approach, if nuclear weapons were to be deployed to Poland and the Baltic states, would involve the B61-12 gravity bombs, which are already part of NATO’s nuclear-sharing framework, but most were removed by the U.S. following the end of the Cold War. These gravity bombs, designed for use by dual-capable aircraft such as the F-35A Lightning II, allows for a stern deterrent combined with U.S. air superiority. Poland has already acquired the F-35A, allowing it to be integrated with existing NATO nuclear-sharing operations. (Kuhn, 2023) However, expanding these nuclear-sharing agreements to Poland and the Baltic states would be highly controversial, likely escalating the already high tensions with Russia, and turning Poland and the Baltics into a high priority target for their imperialist neighbor. (Erästö, 2023)\nNon-Nuclear Alternatives To ensure stability in today’s complex environment, current United States’ policy emphasizes robust non-nuclear deterrence strategies, including the growing cybersecurity environment and collaboration. Understanding that modern threats are multilayered and are everywhere, the United States openly advocates for a multi-domain approach to these threats that integrates cyber defenses, conventional forces, and resistance to disinformation. This is a robust strategy to address the ever-changing environment of modern conflicts, without escalating to nuclear conflict. (Razukevicius, 2025) As of today, cybersecurity has become a highlight of deterrence, with the U.S. and NATO increasing their collaboration on cyber resilience, joint training, and intelligence sharing to counter Russia’s persisting cyber-attacks on Europe. In 2022, NATO had officially recognized that cyberspace is in the domain of their operations, expanding the concept of collective defense to that realm, creating measures to respond to large-scale cyber-attacks. (Center for Strategic and International Studies, n.d.)\nInternational arms control agreements and diplomacy continue to remain at the center for preventing nuclear escalation and maintaining stability, in Europe and internationally. New START, an agreement to limit the number of deployed nuclear warheads between the United States and Russia, has only helped so much in preventing uncontrolled escalation. In 2023, Russia suspended its participation in the New START agreement, making diplomatic efforts more complicated and increasing the concerns about erosion of arms control frameworks. (Reuters, 2023) Despite the reckless move by Russia, the United States and NATO have continued to advocate for diplomatic communication first to calm tensions and escalation, which also enhances transparency between the U.S. and Russia. However, this doesn’t mean in the preventative measures NATO has been investing in either, which are equally as important.\nConclusion The security landscape of Eastern Europe continues to remain as a focal point for NATO’s defense, with Poland and the Baltic states being key players in deterring Russia’s imperialist aggression. Prior to the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.S. has shown strength through reinforcing NATO, especially Poland and the Baltics, with heavily funded initiatives like the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) and NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP), in addition to the expansion of cybersecurity collaboration. While nuclear weapons will continue to be at the forefront of nuclear deterrence, non-nuclear alternatives such as cyber resilience, arms control diplomacy, and conventional military deterrence are equally essential to maintain stability without unnecessary escalation. But keep in mind, Russia continues to challenge the international order and regional security. Putin, with unsettling ease, continues to be open to the idea of nuclear escalation, making the Baltics and Poland at the forefront of NATO’s security framework. With these ongoing threats, the U.S. and NATO are now more than ever, committed to the promise of collective defense. It’s been interesting, and worrisome, to watch this security dilemma unfold and evolve. My perspective and opinion, like the security environment, continues to evolve and change with new information appearing every day. It is young leaders, like me, that are the ones to inherit the world’s conflicts, and it is more important now, than ever, to continue to talk about this and continue research to solve these complex hostilities. References Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.

Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 defied international norms that aimed to set a precedent for national security and individual statehood. The subsequent invasions of Ukraine proved to the global community that Russia would go to extreme lengths to increase its sphere of influence over post-Soviet republics, causing widespread concern surrounding the idea that other countries could be next. In an effort to deter the possibility of a Russian land invasion, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania proposed the Baltic Defense Line, an initiative to enhance military fortifications along their Russian and Belarussian borders. Latvia’s Ministry of Defense has invested heavily to create secure and controlled border mechanisms that rely on heightened military infrastructure with hopes to prevent the aggressive movement of Russian influence into the country. Latvia’s fortification efforts and the wider enforcement of the Baltic Defense Line reflect a necessary shift towards NATO-aligned deterrence and increased territorial control, highlighting a current geopolitical stage that does not dismiss possibilities of invasion. This analysis aims to review government reports and academic articles that assess the necessity and effectiveness of the Baltic Defense Line as it pertains to ensuring a sovereign and secure Latvian state.\nBackground on Latvia’s National Defence Efforts.\nThe Baltic Defense Line and Latvia’s decision to enhance its border fortifications are aligned with a strategic foreign policy that prioritizes national security and careful deterrence of Russian aggression. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 stimulated vast concern amongst the Baltic states, in which there is common sentiment that the outcome of the war corresponds directly to the wellbeing of the Baltics. LSE IDEA, a foreign policy think tank in London, created a report analyzing Latvia’s initial response to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The report points out that many aspects of Latvia’s national defense has been enhanced, including rising numbers in Latvia’s volunteer army and National Guard, participation in NATO military exercises in Latvia with members like the United States Army Special Forces, and the overall increase of the defense budget with hopes to maintain above 3% of GDP in the coming years (LSE IDEA). The report claims that Latvia’s hastened military response to recent Russian aggression is informed by both memories of Soviet occupation and new threats of Russian expansionism (LSE IDEA). From a geographical standpoint, the threat imposed by Russia’s proximity to Latvia is undeniable. The report states that as of 2016, it would take around 36 to 60 hours for Russia to occupy Riga, though it is important to note that much has changed militarily on both sides within the last decade (LSE IDEA). Nonetheless, the report brings light towards the necessity of understanding that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has caused heightened security concerns throughout the Baltics, and changes to national security measures on Latvia’s behalf are on account of challenging Russian aggression in the region. The report continues on to suggest that the Baltic states should collectively continue to identify areas where defence capabilities can be enhanced to further deter Russian influence into the area, focusing on a strong eastern border with permanent troops and military infrastructure (LSE IDEA). LSE IDEA’s comprehensive analysis over Russia’s threat on the Baltic states creates a solid foundation for understanding how Baltic national defense strategies currently center on countering the persistent threat posed by Russia, focusing on deepened collective integration of defense strategies.\nMirroring the collective understanding of Russia’s looming threat over Baltic security amidst its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Latvian government released its Annual Report of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baiba Braže, reinforcing the necessity of strengthened national security efforts. The report emphasizes Latvia’s stark increase in its defense budget in 2024 that reached 3.3% of GDP, in which ample measures were taken to solidify regional defense capabilities to decrease the possibility of a Russian invasion of Latvia (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Latvia). The reports security considerations are rooted in both supporting Ukraine and deterring Russian aggression into the region, in which it is reasonable to infer that Latvia\u0026rsquo;s national security is dependent on a secure and monitored eastern flank. Though the report does not directly reference the Baltic Defense Line, it is a meaningful assessment over the overall necessity of an enhanced Latvia national defense strategy.\nThe Baltic Defense Line It is evident that Latvia and the Baltic states are placing substantial effort into combating the threat of neighboring Russia, and the Baltic Defense Line is extremely representative of this goal. The Ministry of Defense for the Republic of Latvia released a report outlining Latvia’s border fortification efforts that began in 2024. According to the report, the Baltic Defense Line is an initiative to enhance fortifications along the Baltic eastern border, focusing on military infrastructure to directly deter Russia from challenging the Baltic states and NATO (Ministry of Defense Republic of Latvia). Despite the initiative being a collective effort among Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, each state is responsible for individual funding and military developments along its border. The report claims that the Baltic Defense Line initiative contains the Eastern Border Fortification and Counter-mobility Plan, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2024, meaning that the entirety of the Russian and Belarusian-Baltic border will be fortified (Ministry of Defense Republic of Latvia). For Latvia, border reconstruction entails the addition of anti-tank trenches, dragon teeth anti-tank obstacles, storage areas to contain critical defense utilities such as mines and explosives, and methods to quickly close roads and transport routes in the event of an invasion (Ministry of Defense Republic of Latvia). As of current, the Latvian National Armed Forces have begun construction of a physical boundary along the eastern border that is supported by the deployment of two new National Armed Forces units to the border, and 20 defense storage units have been instituted in Latgale (Ministry of Defense Republic of Latvia). The report also lays out the upcoming goals for Latvia’s Baltic Defense Line contribution, stating that the continuation of border enhancements will amount to around 303 million euros over the next five years (Ministry of Defense Republic of Latvia). The report provides a solid baseline for understanding Latvia’s role in defending the Baltic eastern flank, overall supporting the idea that Latvia aims to contribute to NATO’s collective defense strategy against impeding aggressor states such as Russia.\nThe Ministry of Defense for the Republic of Latvia provides an unambiguous perspective for Latvia’s role in the Baltic Defense Line, but it is critical to investigate the challenges and complexities of the initiative. The Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) maintains a practical approach towards analyzing the Baltic Defense Line, claiming that border fortification enhancements along the Baltic eastern flank will be an obstacle in itself. Specifically for Latvia, the FPRI states that Latvia’s extensive border with Russia and Belarus amounts to 133 miles and 107 miles, meaning that the sheer length and varied terrain along the border will potentially complicate construction, resource allocation, and overall monitoring of border developments (FRPI). As Latvia contains little natural boundaries on its eastern flank, in comparison to Estonia’s border that contains Lake Peipus, Lake Pihkva, and the Narva River, Latvia will need to construct more physical fortifications to make up for the lack of natural obstacles. According to the FRPI, this would amount to the necessity of 1,116 bunkers with a density of around five bunkers per linear mile (FRPI). Not only will it be challenging to finalize the construction of over a thousand stationary bunkers along the eastern border, but it will also be challenging to do so without Russia being able to identify the location of the bunkers, leading to reevaluation of its own offensive strategies (FRPI). Latvia must also dedicate valuable discussion over the transportation routes it shares with Russia and Belarus, as there is one railway, two major road crossings, and multiple small road crossings between Latvia and the two states that realistically prevent the construction of bunkers and military infrastructure (FRPI). The FRPI provides analysis over one other aspect of the Baltic Defense Line that potentially stimulates challenges to the overall Baltic national defense strategy, in that prioritizing a static defense posture over elasticity may prove disastrous in the event of an invasion. Setting up bunkers along the border, according to the FRPI, prevents opportunity for maneuver warfare that has historically been favored by NATO and Western defense strategies (FRPI). The Baltic Defense Line by nature implies that guarding terrain is at the forefront of the defense strategy, and military maneuverability is less likely to be accomplished by this method of defense. Nonetheless, the FRPI concludes that the Baltic Defense Line is a reasonable response on behalf of the Batlic states to the current geopolitical implications of neighboring Russia, and it is a solid strategy of potential deterrence towards Russian aggression. This analysis is a critical reminder of the challenges that arise during shifts in defense strategies, and it would be detrimental to dismiss such challenges when assessing the Baltic Defense Line.\nIn an effort to emphasize the level of contribution that the Baltic states must undergo to see a successful Baltic Defense Line, the United States Army War College provides yet another constructive approach towards the initiative. The USAWC compares the Baltic Defense Line to the 1989 Baltic Way movement, where citizens throughout the Baltics linked hands to create a 600km chain in response to Soviet occupation (USAWC). Though the Baltic Defense Line relies on military infrastructure rather than citizen mobilization, it signals the demand of sustained, tangible contributions from each state to achieve meaningful collective security. The USAWC makes the argument that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have committed to providing 60 million euros annually to the initiative, which would amount to around 8% of the defense budget within Latvia and Estonia while only 2.8% for Lithuania (USAWC). When comparing Latvia’s 8% defense contribution to Lithuania’s 2.8% contribution, it raises concerns about unequal defense contributions that would imply asymmetrical responses in national defense strategies, going against a collective Baltic effort that is necessary to deter Russia. Additionally, the USAWC provides a fresh perspective about potential obstacles that arise when citizens may need to willingly give up portions of their land for the government initiative. Noting that the areas in Latvia that are close to major border crossing points, such as Ludza, Viļaka, and Daugavpils, contain a large population of ethnic Russians, it will prove undoubtedly difficult to convince such ethnic populations to allow construction of bunkers on their land, if need be (USAWC). By mentioning the potential challenges that could arise by concentrating the Baltic Defense Line in an area that contains a high amount of ethnic Russians, the USAWC hopes to emphasize that voluntary citizen mobilization that was necessary during the Baltic Way may not be reciprocated in contemporary events of a Russian invasion. However, the USAWC notes that the Baltic Defense Line is undeniably a symbol of Baltic collective effort to maintain statehood and a solid national defense strategy, though highly dependent on efforts of collective collaboration between both all the Baltic states and their respective citizen populations.\nConclusion In our current geopolitical atmosphere where it is clear that Russia will go to extreme lengths to expand its sphere of influence, the Baltic states are forced to revise national defense strategies to ensure their statehood against neighboring Russia. The Baltic Defense Line, or the enhancement of fortifications and military infrastructure along the eastern flank, is representative of such sentiments. Latvia has taken vast measures to secure its border against Russia and Belarus through physical military developments on its eastern border, with plans to continue its fortification efforts to the utmost extent. There are currently multiple reports that assess the overall strength and challenges of the Baltic Defense Line, and it is realistic to claim that despite a common agreement that the initiative will face substantial challenges that range from infrastructural obstacles to inspiring collective effort throughout the Baltics, the Baltic Defense Line is critical to deter Russian aggression from entering the Baltic states. Latvia, a country with around 1.8 million residents, is entirely worth defending, and it is defense strategies such as the Baltic Defense Line that suggest that aggressor states such as Russia should be handled with proactive approaches to ensure security and statehood.\nWork Cited Foreign Policy Research Institute.

It is a relatively small country with a geographical size of 64,594 square kilometers. From the outside looking in, Latvia may appear as a small, peripheral state on Europe’s northeastern edge; yet beneath its modest size lies a nation shaped by profound historical trauma, cultural resilience, and a deeply layered political identity. With a recent history of occupation from both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Latvia continues to integrate perspectives of historical events into contemporary policy. Memory politics, in particular, serve as a cornerstone of Latvia’s defense posture, reinforcing efforts to preserve national identity and sovereignty. As a nation defined by successive occupations in the 20th century, Latvia approaches foreign policy through a lens of historical survival, a posture made ever more critical due to Russia’s renewed imperial ambitions in Ukraine and the region as a whole. This article explores how memory functions as both a political compass and a societal safeguard in Latvia, influencing its responses to present-day threats while preserving the legacy of its past.\nHistorical Context Understanding the role of memory politics in Latvia comes first with understanding the context to which the memory manifests itself from. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia provides a brief analysis of Latvia’s history since it declared its first independence on November 18, 1918 officially from the Russian Empire, as well as German military formations. Sovereignty was recognized by both foreign entities in 1920 following a series of battles throughout Latvia, and the country was able to develop autonomously through parliamentary democratic rule for about 14 years.1 Though those 14 years served as an important stepping stone for implementing democratic practices into everyday Latvian life, there were evident moments of political instability that caused Latvian Prime Minister Karlis Ulmanis to shift towards authoritarian control in 1934 through the simultaneous dissolution of the parliament.1 Shortly after, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in 1939 by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, secretly placing all three Baltic states under Soviet control with no legal backing or collective consent. The pact was intended to act as a non-aggression agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union amidst the start of World War II. Ultimately, it forced Latvia to agree to allowing Soviet military bases within its territory in 1939, further annexing the country into the Soviet Union in 1940.1 The pact proved to be detrimental in all aspects, as Nazi Germany would take control of Latvia in 1941. Soviet occupation in Latvia from 1940-1941 was characterized by harsh oppression and terror. The Cheka, or Soviet secret police NKVD (later KGB) in Latvia, ensured that Latvians remained loyal to Soviet ideologies through the message that anyone could become a political prisoner.2 The NKVD instigated looming threats of arrest and deportation for any real or perceived acts of conspiracy against the Soviet Union, and thousands of Latvians were arrested and even executed. The NKVD was evidently an instrument of terror to stimulate fear throughout Latvian society, as the repercussions for resisting Soviet integration were severe. Not only were Latvian citizens facing the erasure of their culture and lifestyle through routine purges carried out by the NKVD, people were also being ripped away from their homes as well. On June 14, 1941, thousands Latvians were forcibly deported to labor camps in Siberia through an act of political terror, in which families were separated and Latvians were forced to carry out strenuous labor in various gulags.3 Overall, the first Soviet occupation of Latvia was a solemn time of brutal political terror that aimed to suppress Latvian society and identity.\nGerman control over Latvia stimulated an array of sentiments. Initially, many Latvians welcomed the idea of Nazi German occupation of Latvia in 1941, as it was assumed to be a form of liberation against Soviet control. However, Germany began carrying out its own acts of terror that greatly impacted Latvian society. One of the most notable aspects of Nazi occupation in Latvia was the execution of 90% of the Jewish community in Latvia.4 The Holocaust in Latvia was a devastating genocide that deeply impacts Latvian society to this day. Additionally, Nazi Germany forced Latvians to join the Waffen-SS Latvian Legion, essentially mobilizing Latvian citizens against Soviet troops that also contained Latvian citizens.5 About 115,000 Latvians were forced, against international law, to join the Latvian Legion, and many of them became prisoners of war in the Soviet Union after Germany’s defeat.5 Not only were Latvians exploited by Nazi Germany for mandatory military conscription, but many were never able to access social welfare programs or live standard lives following the end of World War II and the second Soviet occupation of Latvia. Nazi Germany’s control of Latvia only lasted until 1944, but it was a grave time of mass executions, ethnic belittlement, and citizen exploitation.\nThe Soviet Union regained control of Latvia in 1944 and executed the second, even larger wave of deportations in 1949. Any effort to promote Latvian statehood was diminished by the Soviet Union, and the next 47 years would be a time of stark russification and sovietization. Latvians were expected to adhere to Russian cultural practices, most notably by the full integration of Russian language into Latvian society, and Russian became the established official language of the country.6 Public institutions were expected to conduct business in Russian language, and Latvian language was effectively extinguished from everyday life.5 Additionally, the Soviet Union encouraged immigration of ethnic Russians into Latvia, in which Russians heavily impacted the ethnic makeup and cultural integrity of the country. These Russians were not expected to learn Latvian language or integrate into Latvian society, as the society was evidently tailored towards Russian ideologies. The dismantlement of a Latvian national identity was intentional and strategic, as the essence of the Soviet Union relied on a collective Soviet identity. Noncompliance to embracing such identity was challenged by arrest or deportation.6 Russification in Latvia meant that by 1989, ethnic Latvians only made up about 52% of the population, manifesting a period where Latvians were the minority ethnic group in certain areas of the country, including Riga.6 This was incredibly belittling and dehumanizing for Latvians, as both official state autonomy and cultural autonomy had been stripped away. Decades of suppression effectively allowed Latvia and the Baltic region as a whole to understand the necessity of fighting for individual statehood, and the Baltics began advocating for official independence in 1989.6 Though many acts of advocating for autonomy were faced with violence and condemnation from the Soviet Union, Latvia and the Baltic region were officially recognized as independent in September of 1991, finalized by the fall of the Soviet Union in December. It was a monumental achievement for Latvians who had faced oppression and political terror for decades, but the ethnic and political tensions caused by the memory of forced integration of Latvians into Russian culture would remain at the forefront of contemporary societal images. The events that occurred in Latvia during the 20th century were defined by successive occupations by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, with both entities bringing mass human suffering and repression. Under prolonged Soviet control, these hardships were intertwined with systematic efforts to dissolve Latvian identity through russification, laying a foundation for the ongoing struggles surrounding historical sentiments and differing narratives of victimhood that are entirely prominent in Latvian politics today.\nMemory Politics in Latvia Latvia’s recent history of occupation and oppression is still fresh in living memory of Latvian citizens, with many people carrying the impacts of such events into contemporary social, cultural, and political situations. The blending of memory into institutional practices is called “memory politics”, where past sentiments are instrumentalized in an effort to shape future events. Memory politics usually involve differing perspectives throughout a collective society, in which historical events can be interpreted various ways with various emotional reactions.7 But because society dedicates substantial effort to recall monumental events of the past, memories can be mobilized in political institutions to ensure that policy can both encourage a collective perspective or ensure that past traumas are not repeated. In the case of Latvia, memory politics have become integrated within political institutions and social movements alike. The Latvian state plays an active role in shaping historical memory, most predominantly through commemoration days, legislation, and state-funded institutions that focus on preserving and highlighting Latvian hardship. The Latvian Saima, or parliament, has created three declarations that define Latvia’s contemporary political focus: “On the occupation of Latvia”, “On the Latvian legionnaires of WWII”, and “On the condemnation of the totalitarian Communist occupation regime implemented in Latvia by the USSR”.8 All three declarations emphasize a pivotal moment in Latvian history that encourage a sense of collective identity against traumatic or oppressive events. The first declaration especially embodies a deep condemnation towards the erasure of Latvia’s sovereignty, in which it officially determined that Latvia’s integration into the Soviet Union was illegal and against international law. The state also plays a part in facilitating national commemoration days to honor those who were affected by impactful events, such as the June 14th commemoration day for the 15,000 deportees in 1941, as well as a remembrance day on March 25 for the victims of the second mass deportations by the Soviet Union in 1949. State-led commemorations are held to not only annually remind individuals of the past traumatic events that shape Latvian society, but also to serve as a stepping stone for justifying legislation and policy that ensure that such events do not happen again.8 To further emphasize the state’s role within effectively institutionalizing memory in politics, former President Guntis Ulmanis created the Commission of Historians of Latvia in 1998, with its central priority being to investigate the crimes and consequences of Soviet and Nazi occupation on Latvia.8 The commission conducts research to provide to schools and government institutions in order to inform Latvian society on the atrocities that occurred during the 20th century, successfully ensuring that memory and history remain prevalent in contemporary policy. It is evident that Latvia has dedicated substantial effort towards mechanizing memory, highlighting the role that the Latvian state plays in deliberately embedding historical narratives into its political structure.\nThe government is not the only entity actively utilizing memory as a conduit for political motives. Latvian civil society has continuously engaged in social movements and political mobilizations to maintain a strong stance on history to inform societal change. One of the most iconic social movements in Latvia was in the 1989 Baltic Way movement where individuals throughout all three Baltic states joined hands in opposition towards Soviet occupation. The Baltic Way was a commemoration towards the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that illegally established Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1939, and the collective Baltic opposition towards Soviet control and past trauma allowed for vast mobilization against the Soviet Union. Though the Baltic Way was a social movement at the time that exemplified stark consideration for memory as a mechanism, it itself has become a powerful message spread within current or recent memory based political movements. All three Baltic states celebrate the anniversary of the Baltic Way every year, recognizing it as a pivotal event that helped manifest independence through the collective effort of individuals within all three Baltic states. Additionally, Latvian political figures regularly reference the Baltic Way as a necessary movement both during its time and for contemporary societal outlooks.\n‘Today the Baltic Way is no more the call for freedom and the demonstration of physical unity. Today the Baltic Way is the road of dynamic advancement, development and the road of cooperation for Europe\u0026rsquo;s common future\u0026quot; (Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Indulis Berzins, 1999).\nDespite a necessary aspect of collective identity that allows memory politics to thrive in a society, civilian and political movements highlight a very important aspect of memory-based politics that is necessary for understanding the challenges of collective identities: different people may perceive a specific event in different ways. This is incredibly evident within memory politics in Latvia, as it is a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multi-linguistic state with an ethnic Russian population of 22%. The presence of two ethnic groups means that memory conflict is often prevalent due to two different collective memories of the same situations, one for Russians and one for Latvians.9 Both ethnic groups carry their own memories and respective “truths” about the events that occured in the country in the 20th century, in which it is widely agreed that Latvians hold a collective memory based on oppression and fear, while Russians generally hold a collective memory that is based on pride for a Soviet Union that beat fascism and encouraged russification. The presence of a dual collective memory in Latvia creates political and cultural fault lines, particularly around WWII anniversaries, commemoration days, and debates about language and citizenship laws. Though events like the Baltic Way highlight the power that memory can play in encouraging vast collective action, the thousands of hands connected across the Baltics should not discount the reality that a universal outlook on Soviet occupation did not, and does not exist.9 True collective memory is nearly impossible to forge when historical experiences diverge so significantly and when past political structures have treated these groups with unequal levels of representation. Social and political movements in Latvia during the 1990s created a distinct, and still present, line between those who aimed to see total Latvian sovereignty and cultural autonomy, and those who wanted to hold on to Soviet ideologies. The utilization of memory within politics can successfully encourage the remembrance of historical challenges that deeply impacted Latvian society, but to fully understand the scope of memory politics comes with recognizing that not every group within society was impacted the same way. Consequently, memory-based events or actions that aim to cast light on past hardships through collective unity highlight divisions within society, as not all ethnic communities and individuals can feel equally represented in a movement where an entity as ambiguous as memory is mobilized.\nMemory-based politics emphasize one other crucial characterization of contemporary Latvian society that is prevalent in other post-occupation states as well: past narratives influence preparation for existential threats of the future.9 Soviet occupation in Latvia undoubtedly acts as a historical truth, but it has managed to become a framework for contemporary vigilance over emerging threats. This implies that memory politics in Latvia is not just about preserving traumatic memories, but weaponizing memories as a tool for defense and resilience. The institutionalization of memory would most likely lose necessity if a perceived existential threat did not exist, but in the case of Latvia, memory has merged with foreign policy especially regarding relations with neighboring Russia.8 There is an evident and deeply rooted sense of victimhood in Latvian national identity that is a result of years of illegal occupation and oppression, manifesting a widely held belief of “if it happened before, it can happen again”. However, Latvian victimhood is a defining factor within efforts of survival and legitimacy, mobilizing society around a common theme of identity preservation that directly merges into foreign policy. In the case of Latvia, victimhood should not be perceived as a form of weakness, rather a necessary lens through which potential threats can be combated and national identity can be maintained. The fear of renewed occupation, particularly rising from the aggressive patterns of Russia, allow memory-backed narratives to remain central in Latvian social and political spheres. The preservation of historical events is a strategic instrumentalization of memory in order to encourage efforts of Latvian statehood while solidifying policies of deterrence and geopolitical alignment amidst growing tension in the Eastern European neighborhood.8\nMemory for Defense Policy\nThe weaponization of memory, specifically sentiments over past occupations and oppressive Soviet framework, has defined Latvia’s current defense and foreign policy. One of the most perceived threats to Latvia is Russia in regards to physical and ideological autonomy.8 Russia’s looming threat on Latvia’s national security became even clearer after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, as well as the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Latvia understands that Russia can accurately be characterized as an aggressor state, with urgency to ensure Latvian national statehood exacerbated by both the geographical position of Russia and the memory of past Soviet occupation over Latvian territory. Therefore, the narrative of memory politics is used to justify the need for intense investment in national defense mechanisms, as seen in many defense initiatives ranging from government spending to NATO-aligned military exercises.\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Membership Latvia began its path towards international strategic partnerships very soon after gaining independence in 1991. Before full integration into NATO, Latvia first joined a NATO program called “Partnership for Peace” in 1994, in which Latvia could work with NATO individually to prioritize defense capabilities and ensure stability at both domestic and foreign levels.10 This early step towards NATO alignment was essential for Latvia in regards to developing a defense strategy, and it emphasized the overall necessity of external partnerships for maintaining total sovereignty. Naturally, Latvia gained full NATO membership in 2004, signaling the start of NATO military presence in Latvia.10 For the next 20 years, NATO-backed military exercises and developments in Latvia would be at a steady increase, with the country proving undoubtedly reliant on Western alignment and foreign partnerships for national defense. In 2017, the enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) group led by Canada was established in Latvia, in which NATO’s eastern flank saw stark increases in defense and deterrence capabilities due to the presence of an enhanced battlegroup backed by over ten NATO member states.11 Through the eFP, Latvia has received military troops from various different countries, including around 2,000 constantly rotated military personnel from Canada, as well as military equipment such as tanks and fighter jets.11 In 2018, NATO began its development of the Multinational Division “North” (MND-N) which is currently headquartered at Camp Adazi in Latvia.10 “North” symbolizes yet another NATO initiative to secure Latvia and the Baltic region as a whole, ensuring that NATO maintains combat readiness on its Eastern flank through the collective effort of various member states including Canada, Germany, Italy, and more.12 “North” officially reached maximum combat readiness in 2023, meaning that the division is fully prepared to deploy, operate, and fight under NATO command in any operational environment.10 Additionally, Latvia created the NATO Multinational Brigade in 2024, becoming the first country to increase its NATO forward presence.13\nLatvia’s integration into NATO and its active participation in military exercises reflect a clear and deliberate geopolitical orientation towards international partnerships and Western alignment. Latvian leaders, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs Baiba Braže, explicitly frame NATO as critical for countering overt and hybrid outside aggression especially in regards to neighboring Russia, rooted in historical sentiments towards occupation and oppression. Since gaining NATO membership in 2004, Latvia has institutionalized its alliance through substantial efforts to maintain and increase NATO presence in the region, as seen through the enhanced Forward Presence and other exercises such as BALTOPs and the Baltic Sentry program. These essential steps embed collective memory into Latvia’s defense culture, transforming NATO from simply a military alliance into a vessel of resilience and vigilance. Though NATO requires member states to maintain at least 2% of GDP towards defense budgets, Latvia has consistently maintained a defense GDP above this threshold and predicts that its 2025 defense budget could amount to 3.65% of GDP towards military capabilities and enhanced infrastructure.15 The sheer amount of state funding dedicated towards defense represents Latvia’s dedication towards not only maintaining strong, reliable relations with NATO, but also dedication towards ensuring a sovereign and secure Latvian state. Each increase in defense spending is memory translated into deterrence and defense.\n“ I think all countries are subject to Russian sub-conventional attacks already now. That means cyber, that means sabotage, that means killings of certain people… So we have to be very sure that we know that we have that intelligence cooperation between military and civilian intelligence, and that we have that situational awareness about what Russia is doing in all respects, not only militarily - meaning where it\u0026rsquo;s moving it\u0026rsquo;s troops, how it\u0026rsquo;s attacking Ukraine, what is Ukraine doing, where is Russia\u0026rsquo;s vulnerabilities - but also about internal security. We have to be very, very sure what is happening. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we all are doing within the alliance (Lativan Minister of Foreign Affairs Baiba Braže, 2025). 14\nLatvia’s National Defense Strategy Latvia’s goals for its national defense initiative emphasize a memory-informed posture towards handling potential threats and security concerns, particularly as it pertains to Russia. In 2023, Latvia released a blueprint for defense strategies and military goals, The State Defense Concept 2023-2027. The concept is mandated by Article 29 of Latvia’s National Security Law, and is revised or updated every Saima term. The current concept outlines many key focuses that range from threat assessments to foreign partnership strategies, but one of the most notable components is its direct reference to Russian security concerns. The concept lays out explicit threats posed by Russia, as well as potential offensive scenarios that Russia could conduct that underline Latvia’s concern over real or perceived Russian aggression. Per the concept, Latvia understands that contemporary Russia exhibits past Soviet characteristics in the sense that it aims to increase its sphere of influence throughout Eastern Europe, fueled by desires to recreate a Soviet-like atmosphere where Russia can dominate a physically and ideologically.16 The concept notes that Russia’s goal for increased regional influence is exacerbated by the overlook of international established laws and norms, reliance on nuclear warfare as a fear tactic, and the transition away from democratic practices into a totalitarian regime complete with propaganda and harsh control over media sources.16 After establishing that Russia is indeed a threat to Latvian national security and should be perceived as an aggressive state with oppressive motives, the concept lays out potential scenarios where Russia could directly breach Latvian defensive strategies. This could be in the form of hybrid threats through the damage of critical infrastructure or cyberattacks, or a on-the-ground military attack through the mass mobilization of infantry troops to seize territory.16\n“The threat to Latvia\u0026rsquo;s security could arise from a sudden military attack by Russia to seize a certain territory that may be followed by threats to use nuclear weapons, aiming to deter involvement of NATO reinforcements” (The State Defense Concept 2023-2027).\nDespite substantial dialogue dedicated towards emphasizing the threat and sheer consequences of Russia and its expansionist goals, the concept lays out a solid doctrine for Latvia’s defense capabilities in opposition to its neighbor. Latvia envisions a defense strategy that is entirely focused on defending territory and human lives, in which the democratic framework of Latvia can be protected only if its physical boundaries are securely maintained.16 Latvian statehood will be preserved through alliances and international partnerships, collective action amongst government institutions and civil society, and deep investment in defense spending and military infrastructure.16 To emphasize how Latvian sovereignty is dependent on collective action, the concept notes that a wide array of institutions and entities, including NGOs, local and national governments, private companies, and civil society, must be readily prepared to overcome security threats on account of Latvia’s survivability.16 The concept and Latvia’s national security goals as a whole are made all the more vital amidst Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in which it was established to the world that Russia will not hesitate to take aggressive routes for its own national interest. Latvia’s defense concept is explicit: Russia is the main threat to national security, and Russia’s capability of a sudden and overwhelming military incursion is undeniable. Latvia’s focus on Russian aggression embeds historical memory of Soviet occupation into its logic and reasoning for a national defense strategy so reliant on defending its statehood against Russian influence, and the war occuring in Ukraine is perceived as a continuation and direct warning of destabilizing behavior that threatens the security of Latvia.\nCivic Identity and Civil-Military Cooperation\nThough defense is often centralized in spheres of military and government institutions, Latvia has proven that national security can be encouraged through cultural programming and civil-military initiatives. Latvian education systems encourage courses over history and contemporary efforts on defense strategies in an effort to expand civic understanding of foreign policy and geopolitical tensions. The Ministry of Defense for Latvia notes that national security is a fundamental concept that Latvian citizens should be exposed to within education systems, hoping to implement a broadened awareness of national security into children that can translate into a desire to participate in such initiatives by higher education.17 The framework behind national defense lessons in education systems surrounds the idea that educators should encourage students to understand Latvian statehood at a cultural and political level, focusing deeply on heightened awareness over the country of Latvia itself in respect towards adversaries and potential threats.17 The Ministry of Defense has also prepared a simulation to be taught in schools in the event of a security breach, allowing children to develop the capacity to both understand and react to events of foreign aggression.17 These efforts within education systems create a framework of societal preparedness, allowing citizens to understand Latvian history and contemporary avenues towards national defense initiatives.\nAs the Latvian Ministry of Defense emphasizes a desire to educate citizens on ways to contribute to national security from young ages, civil-military partnerships highlight how this sentiment directly translates into real-world situations. Almost immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia utilized its new-found independence to establish a volunteer national guard, the Zemessardze.18 The volunteer National Guard currently contains around 10,000 active volunteers that are selflessly working to enhance national security efforts through participation in this civil-military initiative.18 The main objective of the National Guard is to create a sphere where civilians can take part in protecting the sovereignty and national security of Latvia, emphasizing the necessity of collective civilian action to maintain internal and external stability in the country. Additionally, the Zemessardze participated in a military exercise in March of 2025 in collaboration with the Canadian Forces Command, the United States 5th Corps, NATO MND-North, and representatives from various German military brigades.19 The exercise, called NATRIX 2025, aimed to educate Latvian National Guard troops on civil threat assessments and how to relay information in a time of conflict.19 This exercise symbolizes how Latvia is able to utilize civil partnerships for a greater goal of national security initiatives. The Zemessardze also collaborated with local communities and education systems to solidify the relationship between historical awareness and the role of civil society in contemporary threat prevention mechanisms. National security curriculum in school systems, mixed with the collaboration between civilians and military mobilization, reflect a strategic sentiment that an informed and motivated public rooted in collective memory is a critical, but often overlooked, safeguard to Latvian statehood.\nThe key to characterizing defense policy in contemporary Latvia is understanding that defense is not strictly motivated through military terms alone. From NATO membership in 2004 to its comprehensive defense strategy and civil engagement programs, Latvia has integrated memory politics into every layer of its defense architecture. The dedicated efforts that Latvia has taken to develop itself and its security framework reflect an idea larger than just government initiatives, in which these strategies symbolize a nation that remembers what it is like to lose sovereignty. In Latvia, memory is institutionalized, weaponized, and mobilized, especially when re-emerging tensions bring back feelings of uncertainty and existential threats. Latvia’s defense model is evidently framed around utilizing memory as a mechanism for survival.\nThe Future of Memory within Defense It has been established that memory, though inherently based on events from the past, plays a huge role in shaping the dynamics of the future. This notion implies that as long as Latvia continues to develop and enhance its national defense posture, memory will always be an aspect of the process. Latvia has already released a wide array of statements for its goals and aspirations regarding defense and national security, and by underlining the future of Latvia’s defense strategy, it can be more easily understood how memories of historical events translate into the predictive and adaptive nature of national security. One of the most notable aspects of Latvia’s goals for national security is its desire to increase defense spending over the next couple of years. The Latvian Saima has already approved the defense budget for the current 2025 cycle, in which 3.5% of GDP, or 1,559,433,634 euros, will be allocated entirely towards defense.15 The breakup of defense spending ensures that 42% of the cost will go directly towards military developments, specifically the National Armed Forces (NAF).15 In conjunction with the steady increase of the defense budget for 2025, the Saima states that defense spending will reach around 1,655,000,000 euros by 2028.15 As for the 42% of the defense budget that will go to the NAF this current year, the Saima projects that 200.15 million euros will be allocated towards air defense capabilities, 139.61 million euros will go towards ammunition and other forms of equipment, and 111.44 million euros will be put towards infantry vehicles.15 The remainder of the budget will help fund autonomous weapon systems, mortars and long-range rockets, and radar systems for maritime activities.15 The link between rising defense budget and an existential Russian threat highlights a national security policy grounded in the connection between historical and contemporary geopolitical tensions.\nIn conjunction with the bold increase of the Latvian national defense budget, the State Defense Concept references various future goals regarding Latvia’s posture in the global community, maintaining a heavy focus on future relations with foreign partnerships. The concept states that it is critical for Latvia to continue to participate in joint military exercises and multilateral international missions in order to guarantee a future of continuous allyships and global security initiatives.16 Essentially, the future of Latvian relations with external alliances depends on the commitment towards interdependability at a global scale. The concept also states that the future of defense and a sovereign Latvian state depends on Latvia’s ability to defend Ukraine through military aid and political backing.16 Overall, defense policy in Latvia within the coming years is on the basis of promoting global partnerships and international geopolitical stability, and it is in the best interest of Latvia to continue allocating resources towards a solid and cooperative defense structure. As a common theme within memory-based politics and its translation into Latvian defense mechanisms, the past is not just a vessel for remembrance, rather a means of moving forward. Defense policy can instrumentalize memory as a strategic asset for combatting future threats, as seen in increased allocations in defense spending, deepened global partnerships, and the preservation of international order to promote collective security throughout the region.\nConclusion This article intentionally began with examining the historical context in which memory-based politics are rooted from. By doing so, I hope to emphasize the notion that past events are not simply distant backdrops that are left in time, rather the catalyst from which memory politics and contemporary policy can emerge. The trauma in Latvian society from Soviet and Nazi occupations continue to impact ways of life and overall collective outlooks, not just in a sphere of remembrance, but as a critical foundation for influencing current national security initiatives. After discussing the historical events that drastically shape Latvian cultural and political identity, it was necessary to explain the concept of memory-based politics and what this looks like in regards to political and civil institutions. Memory politics in Latvia exist because the impacts of occupation and total loss of autonomy remain prominent in Latvian national consciousness, creating a collective imperative throughout various mediums to never repeat the past. This shared imperative is widely institutionalized through government-backed initiatives and policies, as well as throughout civilian movements and social practices. State institutions mobilize memory as a direct way to influence policy and formal doctrines, while civil society participates in events of preservation to personalize these narratives and mend them into everyday life. Though these forces ensure that memory can greatly influence Latvia’s political and social atmosphere, it is important to note that collective memory and movements cannot realistically exist with the presence of groups that do not share the same experiences and levels of trauma. In the case of Lativan occupation, the ethnic Russian population represents a group of individuals who may not feel the impacts of memory politics as strongly, nor do they feel the need to mobilize as greatly against the entities that caused so much trauma and oppression against the Latvian community. Nonetheless, memory plays a large role in informing national identity, encouraging civil engagement and collective movements, and influencing defense and security strategy through a number of ways.\nWhile memory politics might be seen as a sensitive or even vulnerable reaction to past trauma, in Latvia it serves as a powerful foundation for robust defense mechanisms. Sentiments from the past encouraged the movement towards extremely valuable international partnerships, solidified by permanent military presence in the country by a number of foreign alliances. Memories of past occupations also heavily aid Latvia in remaining vigilant and open to the idea of future security concerns, arguably allowing the country to gain a strategic headstart in deterring and defending against existential threats like neighboring Russia. Rather than a perceived weakness from holding on to traumas from the past, memory and a conscious engagement with history fuels national defense initiatives, shapes public and political outlooks on geopolitics, and most importantly, ensures that sovereignty in Latvia is a priority in order to safeguard against the erasure of a national identity that Latvians cherish and take deep pride in.\nCitations  Embassy of the Republic of Latvia to the Kingdom of Belgium.

Over the past two decades, the EU has lost trade share in Latin America to China, whose growing presence in the region—particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, and critical minerals—has shifted the balance of power. Simultaneously, the United States has adopted a more protectionist stance, creating gaps in global trade leadership.\nThe EU-Mercosur agreement aims to re-establish the EU as a relevant economic partner in Latin America by eliminating tariffs on industrial goods, improving access to raw materials, and reinforcing a rules-based trade framework. While the deal offers strategic opportunities, it has also faced strong opposition within the EU, especially from countries with large agricultural sectors concerned about environmental and competitive impacts.\nThe report analyzes individual EU Member States’ positions, examines the influence of external actors such as China and Russia, and outlines the broader stakes of ratifying the agreement, with particular attention given to the agreement’s impacts on the Baltic States and surrounding nations. Ultimately, the EU-Mercosur deal reflects a broader question: how the European Union will position itself amid growing geopolitical fragmentation and shifting global trade norms, and how will the ratification of the EU trade deal affect the Baltic States?\nIntroduction and background Mercosur, short for Mercado Común del Sur (Southern Common Market), is a South American trade bloc established in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay to foster regional integration through free movement of goods, services, and people. With a combined population of over 270 million and an economic base rooted in agriculture, livestock, and raw materials, Mercosur plays a strategic role in global trade, particularly in commodities such as beef, soy, and iron ore. The European Union (EU) and Mercosur initiated trade negotiations in 1999, aiming to forge closer economic and political ties. Following two decades of protracted negotiations, the two parties reached a political agreement in 2019, promising to eliminate tariffs on over 90% of traded goods, enhance cooperation in areas like intellectual property and public procurement, and integrate both regions more deeply into global value chains. The EU has been especially motivated to finalize the agreement as a way to position itself as a reliable alternative to China, which has significantly expanded its economic influence in Latin America in recent years, and which stands today as Mercosur’s top trading partner. At the same time, rising protectionism from the United States has pushed the EU to diversify its trade relationships and assert more strategic autonomy on the global stage. Thus, on December 6, 2024, in Montevideo, Uruguay, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen formally announced the conclusion of the long-awaited EU-Mercosur agreement, marking a pivotal moment in EU-Latin America relations. However, the ratification process has been slowed by internal EU opposition, driven by concerns over deforestation in the Amazon, weak enforcement of sustainability commitments, threats to domestic agricultural interests, and a broader rise in protectionist sentiment.\nCurrently, the text of the agreement is undergoing legal revision and translation in all 24 official EU languages, and from there, the European Commission will pass along suggestions to the European Council for final decisions and conclusions.1 Per European Commission Directorate-General for Trade and Economic Security Paolo Garzotti, this phase will likely conclude by mid-July. Next, the agreement will make its way to the European Parliament, where it will be debated by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Per the EU’s Rules of Procedure, Parliament decides by a single vote to give its consent to the conclusion, renewal, or amendment of an international agreement. Following Parliament’s consent, the Council would be able to adopt a decision to conclude the agreement pursuant to the procedure and voting rules, which Garzotti notes is likely to be approved by the end of 2025.\nRight now, the EU-Mercosur Agreement remains in limbo. While the European Commission has continued technical revisions to address environmental and labor-related safeguards, several key EU countries, like France and Austria, have voiced firm opposition to ratifying the deal without stronger guarantees on climate and human rights protections. Meanwhile, Mercosur members, especially Brazil and Argentina, have expressed frustration over what they perceive as shifting goalposts and economic marginalization. Multiple EU Member States, including Poland, France, and Lithuania, have expressed opposition to advancing the agreement, citing concerns that agricultural imports from Mercosur countries could undermine the competitiveness of their own domestic sectors.\nCurrent political stances Significant political hurdles still impede the ratification of the EU-Mercosur agreement—chief among them, the challenge of persuading skeptical Member States to align with the supporting coalition by year’s end. In order to ratify the agreement, the deal requires support from 55% of EU Member States representing 65% of the population. France, Ireland, Lithuania, and Poland currently oppose the agreement, citing the potential for unfair agricultural competition from Mercosur countries as their primary concern. Several other nations with reservations—Austria, Belgium, and Romania—may choose to abstain from voting altogether. As such, the position of two major swing states—Italy and Poland—is decisive, considering that together they represent approximately 21.6% of the EU population.2 Italy has shown a mixed stance, with both positive signals and concerns related to fair competition and environmental safeguards. If both Italy and Poland support the agreement, the population threshold would be comfortably met. However, if either abstains or votes against, the deal risks falling short of approval. In turn, the preceding actions of the Baltic States—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—will prove critical moving forward with trade negotiations.\nFrance remains in stark opposition to the trade deal, even as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva traveled to Paris in early June to urge French President Emmanuel Macron to support the accord. Macron argues that the deal as it stands would hurt French and European farmers by forcing them to compete with South American producers who are not held to the same agricultural standards. Macron notes that the text of the agreement could be improved with the insertion of mirror clauses, which Garzotti of the European Commission holds as impractical and costly.3 Regardless, on June 17th, France’s Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard announced that an \u0026ldquo;additional protocol\u0026rdquo; to the EU-Mercosur trade deal, including additional safeguards for agriculture, is under discussion to secure Paris’s—and potentially Warsaw’s—support for the agreement.4 Germany, Europe’s largest economy, remains a strong proponent of the EU-Mercosur deal. The country stands to benefit more than most EU Member States from the agreement, particularly due to its large industrial base and strong export orientation. Germany relies heavily on global markets for its automotive, machinery, and chemical sectors—three industries that are central to the Mercosur agreement. German carmakers, who have faced years of sluggish growth and increased competition from both Chinese Electric Vehicles (EVs) and American firms, are especially eager to access Mercosur’s markets. Currently, passenger cars exported to Mercosur countries face tariffs of up to 35%, which has significantly limited German automotive competitiveness in the region.5 The EU-Mercosur agreement would phase out these tariffs, potentially revitalizing exports at a time when domestic and European demand remains weak.\nThis is particularly crucial for Germany’s Mittelstand—the country’s small and medium-sized industrial suppliers, many of whom are deeply integrated into automotive and machinery supply chains and are struggling with slowing orders and rising costs. Similarly, Germany’s chemical industry is eyeing Mercosur markets as growth opportunities amid tightening environmental regulations and cost pressures at home. The EU-Mercosur deal would remove tariffs of up to 18% on chemical exports, making it easier for German firms to expand abroad while preserving their global market share.\nPoland’s stance on the EU-Mercosur agreement is shaped largely by the interests of its powerful agricultural sector, which accounts for over 3% of national GDP and employs around 10% of the workforce, among the highest shares in the EU.6 Just a few days before the signing of the agreement in December, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that \u0026ldquo;Poland will not accept\u0026hellip; the free trade agreement with the South American countries… in this form,” noting \u0026ldquo;concern for Polish farmers and food security.\u0026ldquo;7 This comes as the nation’s farmers have voiced reservations about being undercut by Mercosur producers who operate under significantly looser environmental, labor, and animal welfare standards. Moreover, at the June 23rd Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) hearing on the geopolitical aspects of the EU-Mercosur agreement, Polish MEP Grzegorz Braun—of the far-right party Confederation of the Polish Crown, and a fourth-place finisher in Poland’s 2025 presidential election—expressed strong indignation at the accord. Addressing the committee, Braun said: “[With this deal] you make it impossible for agriculture in my country to compete. Then you come with the idea of inviting everybody from all around—from Ukraine, from South America—to sell anything they want… obviously cheaper, because they don’t have to meet these irrational rules… And today, to make me more interested, you add that this is how you’ll fight Russia, and Iran, and China…The European Union has to be overthrown.”8\nWhile newly elected Polish President Karol Nawrocki has yet to comment publicly regarding the EU-Mercosur deal, it appears unlikely that he will come out in support of such an accord. Nawrocki, a right-wing populist with ‘Poland-First’ values, holds a strong base with Polish farmers and remains skeptical of what he sees as far-reaching EU policy, making him an improbable proponent of a comprehensive international trade deal.9 Nevertheless, Garzotti surmises that Nawrocki’s June victory will have little impact on getting the EU-Mercosur deal ratified by December, especially considering the President’s largely symbolic role in Poland.\nIn December, Lithuanian Minister of Agriculture Ignas Hofmanas announced the country’s condemnation of the trade deal, saying to reporters, \u0026ldquo;Our agricultural sector is especially affected when it comes to meat, poultry, and beef. Since we grow most of our agricultural produce and export a significant share, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this agreement offers us any opportunity.”10 Since December, Vilnius has not publicly altered its stance on the EU-Mercosur deal.\nLatvia is the only Baltic nation to endorse the EU-Mercosur agreement. The day the accord was signed in Montevideo, Latvian MEP Inese Vaidere highlighted that “[The] agreement simplifies exports, reduces tariffs and sets standards, leading to significant job opportunities and economic growth in Europe,” noting further that the deal is “\u0026hellip;good news for consumers, economic growth and jobs in Europe and also in Latvia. It is essential at a time when we want to diversify supply chains to ensure the EU\u0026rsquo;s strategic autonomy and when trade with the US is likely to become more difficult.”11 In April, Latvian State Secretary Andžejs Viļumsons met with Argentine Ambassador Carlos Federico Mascias in Riga, where Viļumsons voiced support for signing the EU-Mercosur deal quickly, highlighting the potential for new trade opportunities between Latvia and Latin America.12\nThat said, while members of Latvia’s agricultural sector have not publicly voiced opposition to the deal, the Latvian Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) expressed reservations in a statement to the Baltic Security Foundation. The Ministry warned that “Latvian farmers may face an indirect negative impact from increasing imports of… products from Mercosur,” which could “reduce the competitiveness and outlet possibilities for Latvian producers.” As such, the Ministry emphasized the need for the European Commission to monitor market developments closely, enforce strict SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) controls, and apply a safeguard clause if necessary.13 This response suggests that, despite Latvia’s general support for the agreement, concerns over long-term competitiveness in agriculture persist, highlighting the kind of behind-the-scenes pressure that may shape how the deal is implemented at the EU level.\nEstonia has yet to express an official opinion on the EU-Mercosur deal. While Estonia’s farming sector is significantly smaller than those of its Baltic neighbors, potentially reducing the risk of domestic pushback, it remains unclear whether Estonian MEPs will abstain from voting when the deal reaches Parliament. For now, proponents of the accord are not counting on support from Tallinn.\nEconomic and political intersections As usual, certain aspects of the EU-Mercosur agreement have experienced heightened politicization, including several less consequential issues. As noted previously, four EU Member States—France, Ireland, Lithuania, and Poland—have publicly opposed the deal, all noting concerns for their respective agricultural sectors. However, it appears that such unease may have been amplified in the media, which is due in part to the institutional strength of European agricultural interests. This development, of course, is unsurprising to observers of the European political landscape, who have noted an increase in both the frequency and political salience of farmers' protests in recent years. The EU-Mercosur deal proves no exception. In Poland, farmers took to the streets across the country in January to protest various “dictates from Brussels,” including the signing of the previous month’s accord in Montevideo.14 Protests were reported in 23 locations across the country, the largest of which—attracting over 50 tractors—took place in the northern city of Elbląg, situated at the heart of one of Poland’s major agricultural regions. Protesters were accompanied by a large figure of the Grim Reaper, symbolising the death of Polish agriculture, while others waved banners containing anti-EU imagery, including some calling for “Polexit” from the bloc. Lithuania, the Baltic’s largest agricultural economy, is no stranger to protests of this sort, either. Last January, over 5,000 farmers driving more than 500 tractors took to the streets of Vilnius to protest a policy unrelated to the EU-Mercosur deal. A smaller but sizable coalition also plans to occupy space in front of the Seimas at the end of June in protest of Personal Income Tax (PIT) and State Social Insurance (SSI) laws, as well as road taxation.15 Such events speak to the organization of agricultural interests in the region and across the continent, spurred by administrative entities like the European Rural Parliament, a non-EU affiliated institution which aims to strengthen the voice of rural communities in Europe and ensure their interests are reflected in national and European policies.16\nPrior to being appointed Lithuania’s Minister of Agriculture, Hofmanas, a notable critic of the EU-Mercosur deal, served as a farmer for 15 years and then as chairman for the Lithuanian Agricultural Council, a non-governmental organization that represents and protects the interests of Lithuanian farmers.17 Today, Hofmanas serves under the Nemunas Dawn party, which some critics label as right-wing populist. The party, however, identifies as center-left, citing its economic policies focused on protecting rural and agricultural interests. Regardless, keeping Lithuania’s agricultural sector at bay is a key concern of Nemunas Dawn and other members of the current Lithuanian coalition, considering the political strength of the country’s shrinking but mighty farming sector, a common sentiment echoed by leaders around Europe, including Nawrocki in Poland.\nThe number of farms and farming-related employment in the EU has been steadily declining for decades, dropping by over 30% and 37% respectively in the past 15 years.18 This trend is especially evident in rural areas of Poland and Lithuania, where farm numbers have fallen by over 30% in recent years.19 Similar patterns appear across the region: Latvia has seen a 17% decrease, and Estonia a 25% drop.20 Compounding the issue are demographic challenges: Latvia and Lithuania have the highest rates of depopulation in the world, with Latvia losing 18% and Lithuania 17% of their populations between 2000 and 2017, while rural regions are experiencing the fastest decline.21\nIt is key to understand that these trends are interconnected. Today, the European farming sector—and in particular, those of Lithuania and Poland—faces mounting pressures from declining farm numbers, increasingly demanding environmental regulations, and a slow but steady erosion of its traditional foundations—all of which are fueling calls for stronger protective policies. It is also crucial to recognize that Lithuania and Poland—both former Soviet republics, and neighbors to Kaliningrad, Russian-aligned Belarus, and, in Poland’s case, Ukraine—retain a vivid memory of Soviet occupation and feel the impact of the war in Ukraine especially deeply. Therefore, agriculture is viewed by farmers and non-farmers alike as a tool of national security; protecting the sector is key to sovereignty. Agricultural self-sufficiency is increasingly viewed as a matter of national resilience—particularly in times of crisis—offering a safeguard against overreliance on external sources for essential resources. Such feelings are amplified in the Baltics, where states like Lithuania, compared to larger nations like Poland, hold less bargaining power in the EU and remain especially vulnerable to Russian interference. In turn, the Ministers of Agriculture of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania convened in April to sign a joint declaration calling for additional funding through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the wake of Russian aggression in Ukraine. In the declaration, the ministers note “the EU’s Eastern border regions’ rural areas particular vulnerability due to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine” and the need to provide “strong and separate EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the agri-food sector that is ensuring its primary objective of food production and food sovereignty under the current pressure of geopolitical tensions.”22 Given this firm stance by the Baltic States—alongside recent joint calls from Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius to “significantly increase assistance to Ukraine—political, economic, humanitarian, military—all types of assistance”—it is essential to consider the historical and political contexts shaping current strategy towards EU, Mercosur, and beyond.23 Moreover, because of the Baltics’ physical closeness and lingering historical memory of Russian occupation, policy regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will likely shape regional reactions towards the EU-Mercosur deal. This also opens the door to further speculation about the positions of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania regarding the ratification of the EU-Mercosur agreement. While Latvia has publicly affirmed its support, recent signals—including the joint statement from the Baltic Ministries of Agriculture—suggest that Riga, like Vilnius, could potentially reconsider its stance. While Estonia has not yet taken an official position, growing pressure from domestic agricultural interests could influence how MEPs from all three Baltic States ultimately vote on the accord.\nEnergy For the Baltic States, the stakes of the EU-Mercosur deal are particularly high, tied to a broader strategy of reducing strategic dependencies and cutting residual economic links to Russia. With Russian drones crashing in the Latvian countryside, undersea cables in the Baltic Sea mysteriously severed, and some experts warning of a possible near-term invasion, it’s no surprise that leaders in Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius remain deeply committed to distancing themselves from Russian interests.24\nPrior to the invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics as a whole still acquired an estimated 74% of their total natural gas from Russia.25 However, in a slew of preceding actions against Moscow, Lithuania was the first country in Europe to halt imports of Russian gas on April 1st, 2022, with Estonia and Latvia immediately following suit.26 In turn, European benchmark prices for natural gas rose on average by 163% in 2022. Research by the European Central Bank has estimated that the 2023 gas shock added as much as two percentage points to inflation, making it the single largest component of that year’s inflation shock.27 While natural gas imports were cut off quickly, the Baltics—arguably the region’s most vocal critics of Russian aggression—remained connected to Russia’s power grid long after gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2018, the Baltics formally committed to disconnecting from the Russian energy grid and, in February of this year, completed the long-awaited switch to the European grid—a move accelerated by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.28 Since 2022, under the REPowerEU Plan, the EU has cut its Russian gas imports from 45% to 19%. Still, the transition is ongoing: Russian gas, oil, and nuclear energy continue to play key roles in the EU energy mix, with a full phase-out of Russian gas planned by 2027.29 In 2024, Norway was the top supplier of gas to the EU, providing over 33% of all gas imports. Russia remained the second largest supplier, followed by the United States and Algeria, among others.30 As a result, the EU—particularly the Baltic States—is seeking new energy sources to maintain energy independence and overall security, with a continued focus on reducing reliance on Russia.\nNoting these points, it is crucial to recognize the role that Mercosur can play in the ongoing EU energy transition. European reliance on fossil fuels has generally decreased with time, due to the rise of renewable energy. That said, in 2022, the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels for its overall energy supply stood at 70.9%, an increase from 2021’s 69.9%.31 Russian fossil fuel imports in the EU from 2022 to 2023 went from 21% to 4% for oil and petroleum products, 24% to 14% for natural gas, and 23% to 1% for solid fossil fuels, thanks to EU sanctions on oil and coal from Russia. However, Russian gas imports registered a 19% year-over-year increase in 2024 compared to 2023.32 At the same time, Latin American oil exports to Europe have begun to make a modest contribution to European energy security. The volume of Brazilian crude being shipped to European ports has increased substantially since February 2022, and its share has risen to 3%, compared with 1.9% in 2021. Moving forward, Latin America is poised to make a modest but not insignificant contribution to European efforts to diversify away from Russian fossil imports.33 For the Baltics specifically—three states without an abundance of fossil fuels—this aspect of the EU-Mercosur deal is critical, even as the region gradually transitions towards renewable energy. The addition of South American fossil fuels to the European market demonstrates future avenues for collaboration between the two regions, especially as reliance on Russian energy diminishes.\nStill, many in the EU have raised concerns about the Latin American fossil fuel industry, citing unease with environmental degradation in South America. In the June 24th EU Parliament Hearing by the Committee on International Trade (INTA) regarding the The EU-Mercosur agreement, numerous MEPs—from nations beyond Poland and Lithuania—raised issue with allegedly exploitative labor and environmental practices in the Latin American farming and energy sectors, including Belgian MEP Bricmont of the Greens who urged members of the committee to “consider those not at the table.”34 This pushback comes in the wake of the signing of the EU-Latin American Energy Organisation (OLADE) memorandum from May, which noted a commitment to reduce methane emissions across various sectors, including agriculture, fossil fuels, and transport within Latin America.35 Furthermore, an issue has been raised regarding the limitations of Latin American infrastructure in supplying fossil fuels to Europe, as Latin America’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) market remains underdeveloped and is primarily geared towards US seasonal imports. Given the technical complexity and investment requirements of exporting LNG, only Peru and Trinidad and Tobago—non-Mercosur members—have infrastructure and production capacity to supply the European market as of 2023. That said, Argentina and Brazil have significant potential for LNG exports due to abundant natural gas reserves in Vaca Muerta and Santos. While challenges such as regulatory hurdles, financing, and political stability remain, it is possible that the ratification of an EU-Mercosur agreement could help speed up the process, providing reduced barriers to financing and cooperation between Argentina, Brazil, and the EU.36\nMeanwhile, both the EU and Mercosur are actively transitioning away from fossil fuels and have publicly committed to developing renewable energy sources. In this way, Mercosur proves a role model for Europe and the Baltics, considering that Uruguay and Paraguay have almost 100% green electric grids, while Brazil\u0026rsquo;s is 85% green, levels much higher than the EU\u0026rsquo;s 39%.37 The Baltic States continue to outperform the EU average in renewable energy use, positioning themselves as emerging leaders in hydropower, wind, and solar energy. In 2023, Latvia—widely recognized as an EU frontrunner in renewable energy—saw a 59% drop in average electricity prices compared to 2022. That same year, 77.6% of Latvia’s electricity was generated from renewable sources, and 88.3% of its total electricity consumption was met through local generation, with Estonia and Lithuania reporting similar achievements.38 Renewable energy development lies at the heart of the Baltic energy security strategies.\nLithuania, in particular, has set a bold target: to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2050, underscoring the region’s commitment to clean energy independence.39 The accord, which the EU notes embodies a shared commitment to sustainable development and will serve to promote the green transition, would prove a valuable avenue for collaboration between the Baltics and South America in terms of renewable energy development, allowing for technology transfer via tariff reduction, along with the opening of regulatory cooperation channels.40 For the Baltics, the ratification of the agreement could unlock a new region filled with green energy expertise, helping in its push for energy independence and a future more secure from the Russian threat.\nLatin America holds abundant reserves of critical minerals like lithium and ammonia that are key to Europe\u0026rsquo;s energy and agriculture sectors. For the Baltic States, this is especially important as they work to reduce dependence on Russia and strengthen strategic supply chains. In particular, lithium is one of the 34 critical raw materials listed by the EU under the Critical Raw Materials Act, and a key component in the EU’s quest to ditch fossil fuels and switch to clean energy.41 Because Argentina and Brazil are major producers of lithium, the EU-Mercosur agreement could help the EU secure an efficient, reliable, and sustainable flow of the raw materials that are critical for the clean transition and for the EU\u0026rsquo;s strategic autonomy more widely.42 Furthermore, the Baltics are rapidly expanding renewable energy, especially wind and solar. But renewables need battery storage to be reliable. Access to lithium enables the development of local storage solutions, reducing the need for Russian gas or other fossil fuel backups, crucial to regional energy independence.\nStill, opponents argue that the South American lithium supply chain has its faults and should not be strongly considered in the European energy transition. During the June 23rd AFET Hearing in Brussels, Thomas Waitz, Austrian MEP representing the Greens, noted, “You talked about lithium. We have a lot of lithium in the European Union. Why are we not digging it in the European Union? Because the environmental impacts are heavy and we don’t want to see them in our backyard. But we are okay if this happens across the pond. How can we secure that the sourcing of resources is happening in uh, let’s say, a sensible way. Also with respect of social rights, of indigenous rights, of workers rights. So, for me the question is not do we need this agreement, but what can we still do to ensure that it seriously works not only for the EU but also for Brazilian economy and farmers.”\nDefense The European Union imported 5.34 million tons of iron and steel products from Russia in 2024. Despite the sanctions, Russian producers continue to generate significant revenues from exports to the EU, with the amount exceeding €2.5 billion last year. Key to this trade relationship is pig iron, a raw material essential to steel production and critical to defense manufacturing.\nDespite existing EU sanctions, imports of Russian pig iron surged by 23% year-over-year in early 2025, largely due to global supply constraints and elevated prices in alternative markets. In 2024, Latvia specifically imported 147,72 thousand tons of pig iron from Russia, a 43.1%\nyear-over-year increase. Despite sanctions, EU imports of other iron and steel products from Russia rose by 28% year-over-year in Q1, driven by Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and other semi-finished steel products. Notably, in total, Russian DRI supplies to the EU accounted for about 40% of all DRI imports to the bloc, raising serious concerns for the credibility and resilience of the European defense sector.43 Not only does this dependence undermine the effectiveness of sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but it also creates a strategic contradiction: while the EU supplies military and logistical support to Kyiv, it simultaneously sources critical materials from the very state it aims to deter. Mercosur remains a top global producer of iron and steel products, offering potential refuge to the EU as it searches for new sources of critical goods in the wake of Russian aggression. Notably, Brazil produces 36% of the world’s pig iron and remains a growing partner of the EU in this sector.44 The country is also expanding its DRI production abilities, which could help the EU with its renewable energy transition, though development on the Brazilian side is still needed. Mercosur remains a top global exporter of iron ore as well—and with a reduction in tariffs brought on by the ratification of the EU-Mercosur deal, a partnership between the two blocs would be integral in helping the EU end its sanctions-evading reliance on Russia.45\nAgriculture For the Baltic States, the stakes of the EU-Mercosur deal go beyond energy, touching sectors like agriculture and rural development. Although Lithuania stopped purchasing Russian gas in 2022, ammonia produced from Russia continues to be imported into the country, as there is no EU ban on such imports. In parallel, the EU continues to rely on Russia for specific critical raw materials like palladium, titanium, and nickel, which are essential for aerospace, electronics, and green technologies, even as Lithuania\u0026rsquo;s Minister of Economy and Innovation previously stated that “any economic ties with Russia should be viewed extremely negatively, even if they are technically legal.” Nonetheless, between early 2022 and the end of Q1 of 2025, Lithuania imported €157.3 million worth of Russian-made ammonia.46 Notably, between 2020 and 2025, well over 90% of all ammonia imported into Lithuania was of Russian origin, representing a general trend in the region, as exports of mineral fertilizers from Russia to the EU increased by 43% year-over-year in 2024.47 This reliance proves a significant weak spot for regional food security, as ammonia is among the most vital products in the chemical industry, serving as a key raw material for critical agricultural fertilizers. Moreover, this is not simply a threat for the Baltic States, but for Mercosur as well, considering that Russia supplies over 30% of mineral and potash fertilizers to Mercosur countries, giving it outsized influence over Latin America’s food production systems.48\nRegardless, internal strife in the Lithuanian Parliament has raised questions about the country’s commitment to cutting all ties with Moscow, no matter how severe. Earlier this month, Lithuania\u0026rsquo;s parliament opened debate on legislation that would allow the country to impose national-level economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus should the European Union fail to extend its bloc-wide measures.49 The law, which passed comfortably, was introduced by Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys, who warned that divisions within the EU over sanctioning Moscow and Minsk risk weakening the bloc’s response to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the majority of the Nemunas Dawn party’s 19 representatives in the Seimas voted against the proposed extension of sanctions, objecting to the inclusion of agricultural products and animal feed in the import ban.50 Ammonia—still heavily imported from Russia—was left out of the measure. Hofmanas maintained his support for the ban, highlighting that Lithuania has the moral right to impose it.\nThe issue of where to source ammonia if not from Russia remains salient. Today, the majority of Russian ammonia is purchased by Lithuanian nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer Achema. Achema notes that there are no operational ammonia terminals in the Baltic States, making it impossible to source ammonia from the U.S. or other alternative suppliers.51 According to Achema’s Head of Communications, the company was forced to purchase Russian ammonia to fulfill contractual obligations to clients. Contrary to Achema’s statement, though, there are numerous ammonia terminals in the region—including a Latvian port in Ventspils and another in Sillamäe, Estonia, along with several in Poland and Finland, demonstrating that the Baltics can transition away from Russian ammonia.52\nThe EU-Mercosur partnership could open new avenues for Baltic access to alternative ammonia supplies, particularly from Latin America’s expanding clean ammonia sector. In 2023, the Netherlands signed a deal with Brazilian renewable energy developer Casa dos Ventos to receive 2.2 million tonnes of ammonia annually via the Port of Rotterdam starting in 2026.53 That same year, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an agreement enabling shipments of Brazilian ammonia from Piauí to the Port of Krk in Croatia—positioning Brazil as a rising supplier for southeastern Europe.54 Meanwhile, in Paraguay, a new heads of terms agreement secured the long-term supply of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) needed to produce electrolytic hydrogen, ammonia, and ultimately fertilizer.55 These developments highlight Latin America’s growing role in Europe’s ammonia supply chain, offering the Baltic States new partnership opportunities as they reduce reliance on Russian inputs.\nAnother key concern is grain production, a particularly sensitive issue for farmers in Lithuania and Poland, driven by the influx of grain from both Russia and Ukraine. In Poland, farmers are especially alarmed by what they see as a surge in Ukrainian imports into the EU market, enabled by the liberalization of trade with Ukraine in early 2022. This influx entered without restriction, disrupted domestic markets, and prompted Polish companies to purchase cheaper Ukrainian grain—grain that, according to protesting farmers, does not meet the same high standards required within the EU. For Polish farmers, the EU-Mercosur deal signals a repeat of this problem: easier access to European markets for grain and other agricultural products from countries not bound by EU regulations. While EU farmers must comply with strict standards on quality, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability—raising production costs—producers in Mercosur countries face different requirements. This imbalance could potentially create risks of unfair competition and the pushing down of prices for domestic farmers already under strain.\nFarmers in Lithuania note that their concerns lie with the influx of Russian grain into the EU instead of Ukrainian grain. As the EU has not put sanctions on Russian food products, some farmers claim that the influx of Russian grain lowers the prices of their exports. In particular, in early 2024, Lithuanian MEP Bronis Ropė argued that large quantities of Russian grain were able to enter the EU through both Latvia and Lithuania, causing grain prices in Lithuania to fall by a third.56 By that December, Hofmanas signed a memorandum of understanding with his Ukrainian counterpart, Vitaliy Koval, “based on which Russian grain transiting the port of Klaipeda will be checked for origin,” the text says. The purpose of the check is to make sure that it does not originate from the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia.57 Since, Latvia has banned the import of Russian grain, but Lithuania has not followed suit, leaving Lithuanian farmers frustrated once again.58\nWhile regulatory standards and grain imports remain key points of contention in the EU-Mercosur debate, one consideration is especially important for European farmers, particularly those in Lithuania and Poland: the agreement also opens access to new export markets at a time when such opportunities are urgently needed. Although Brazil is a prominent global player in agricultural production, the country still faces structural challenges when it comes to wheat. Climate constraints, rising domestic demand, falling domestic grain production, and a dependence on imports shape the core dynamics of Brazil’s wheat economy.59 Today, Brazil is among the world’s top 10 importers of grain, relying particularly on Argentina, which has been responsible for more than 80% of Brazil’s imports.60 This opens the door for imports from the EU to the Mercosur bloc, particularly in terms of grain. While many have raised concerns about the influx of South American grain into the European market, it is key to note that Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania all currently outpace Mercosur’s leading wheat producer, Argentina.61\nMoreover, Lithuania today is looking to diversify its grain exports, shifting from Eastern markets to new territories in Africa and South America in response to global changes spurred by Russian aggression in Ukraine and political realignment. Today, over two-thirds of Lithuania’s grain production is exported, with wheat and rapeseed being the dominant crops. The focus on quality has been a defining feature of Lithuanian grain exports, with the country known for its uniform, high-quality wheat. Additionally, Lithuania’s advanced logistical infrastructure ensures the efficient transport of grain to global markets. In recent months, the Lithuanian grain market made its first sales to Mexico and Canada with hopes to reach Mercosur power Brazil soon, thanks to a phytosanitary certificates agreement launched in 2025.62 In short, the EU-Mercosur agreement could provide a crucial platform for Lithuanian and potentially Polish wheat to stand competitive on the world market, helping reinvigorate a struggling grain sector in Poland and the Baltics.\nChina Over the past two decades, the EU has steadily lost ground to China in its trade relationship with Mercosur. In 2000, the EU was Mercosur’s top trading partner, accounting for over 31% of the region’s trade. By 2023, however, that share had declined to just 15%, while China’s share rose to 24%, firmly establishing it as Mercosur’s largest trading partner by a significant margin. This shift has been especially pronounced in key export sectors: China now absorbs nearly 70% of Mercosur’s soybean exports, over 60% of its iron ore, and a dominant share of its beef exports. While EU-Mercosur trade remains meaningful—totaling around $117 billion in 2023—its growth has stagnated. In contrast, China’s trade volume with Mercosur has ballooned to €157 billion.63 The EU not only trails China in export volumes but also has a trade deficit with the region, while China enjoys a significant surplus. These figures reflect both the growing assertiveness of Chinese economic diplomacy in Latin America and the EU’s waning influence in a region it once dominated.\nBeyond Latin America, the EU’s struggle to compete with China’s expanding global trade influence is increasingly visible. China surpassed the U.S. as the EU’s largest goods trading partner in 2020, with bilateral trade reaching over €850 billion in 2023.64 However, this relationship is marked by asymmetry: the EU runs a persistent trade deficit with China, largely due to high volumes of Chinese electronics, machinery, and manufactured goods entering European markets. At the same time, China has strategically deepened its presence in Eastern and Southeastern Europe through initiatives like the Belt and Road and the now-faltering \u0026ldquo;16+1\u0026rdquo; framework, targeting infrastructure, energy, and digital sectors in countries from Hungary to Serbia. While some EU Member States have grown wary of Chinese investment and are pushing for decoupling policies in regards to Beijing, others remain receptive, creating fragmentation within the bloc. In turn, the EU has struggled to offer a unified economic alternative, and its slower decision-making has limited its ability to project influence with the same speed or scale. This broader pattern of Chinese ascendancy, paired with internal EU tensions, underscores the EU’s interest in reviving trade initiatives like the Mercosur agreement.\nWhile China’s trade with Mercosur is concentrated in commodities like soy, iron ore, and beef, the EU’s trade profile with the region is more diversified, yet comparatively less dominant. In 2023, the EU imported over €12 billion in crude oil from Mercosur, primarily from Brazil, making up 22% of the region’s total oil exports. Other key imports include coffee ($3.4 billion, 46% of Mercosur’s total coffee exports) and copper ore, of which the EU accounted for a striking 72%.65 On the export side, the EU mainly sells high-value industrial goods to Mercosur: vehicles, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and machinery, many of which currently face tariffs ranging from 14% to 35%.66 The proposed EU-Mercosur agreement would eliminate most of these tariffs over a roughly 15-year period, significantly enhancing EU competitiveness in these sectors. Although crude oil already enters the EU tariff-free, the agreement would ease restrictions on processed fuels, strategic raw materials like lithium and manganese, and energy transition technologies, facilitating deeper industrial and energy ties. Overall, the trade relationship reflects a broad but not absolute pattern: Mercosur primarily exports natural resources, while the EU predominantly supplies advanced industrial goods. Without the agreement, the EU might risk continuing to lose ground to China, whose foothold in both imports and exports has become increasingly dominant across the Mercosur bloc.\nEmerging connections Beyond energy, agriculture, and trade, the EU-Mercosur deal may carry broader strategic significance for the Baltics—some of which is already beginning to emerge. Just a month after the agreement was signed in Montevideo, Latvian airline airBaltic and Uruguayan startup SUA Líneas Aéreas signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining cooperation. The deal includes the wet lease of up to five Airbus A220-300 aircraft, as well as collaboration on operational setup, pilot training, IT systems, sustainability, and knowledge exchange. While neither airline has explicitly linked the timing of the partnership to the EU-Mercosur agreement, the announcement points to a potential deepening of ties between the Baltic region and Latin America in sectors beyond traditional trade.67\nMoreover, Estonia’s e-Residency program continues to deepen the Baltic region’s ties with Latin America, reflecting a broader trend of nontraditional diplomacy and tech-driven engagement. In 2024, the program saw a record 4,818 new companies established by e-residents—marking a 5% increase from the previous year—and contributed over €66 million in taxes and fees to the Estonian economy. Together, these developments signal a maturing relationship between the Baltics and Latin America—one built not only on traditional trade or diplomacy, but on innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic partnerships.68 As the Baltic States continue to emerge as leaders in the tech sphere—particularly in response to growing cyber threats from Russia—the region is well positioned to serve as a valuable partner for Latin American countries, including those in Mercosur, as they seek to strengthen their own digital resilience amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity.\nRemaining concerns That said, critics of the deal argue that its implementation poses significant risks to both the EU and Mercosur, including potential threats to democratic governance on both sides of the Atlantic. During the AFET hearing in Brussels, MEP Thomas Waitz challenged the committee, pointedly asking, “Are you still sure we share the same values with the government in Argentina?”69 His remark referred to the far-right, populist administration of President Javier Milei, known for its opposition to climate action and LGBTQ+ rights, and which earlier this year threatened to withdraw Argentina from the Paris Climate Accord. Collaboration with governments like Milei’s, opponents argue, may send the wrong message to an already fragmented EU, which in recent years has struggled to rein in democratic backsliding by leaders like Orbán in Hungary and the rise of far-right, populist sentiment across the continent.\nOther concerns relate particularly to climate change and deforestation in both Europe and South America, from the impacts of increased trade on pollution levels to differing environmental standards across countries. Critics of the EU-Mercosur deal urge its proponents to consider the deal’s potential adverse effects on Native communities in the Mercosur sphere, the economic harm the deal could have on small-scale farmers, and serious concerns over deforestation in the Amazon, among others. In response to EU demands, the agreement includes binding sustainability provisions, with mechanisms allowing for the suspension of trade preferences if environmental commitments are not upheld, although this may prove difficult to implement from across the pond and at home, as businesses in the EU fight to keep up with their South American counterparts.\nPotential consessions Taken together, these considerations highlight the need to carefully assess how the EU-Mercosur agreement may evolve going forward, and what specific concessions Member States such as Lithuania and Poland may seek in response to the deal’s ratification. Fleischhauer and Regazzoni highlight that “Some Member States appear to be exploiting the Mercosur negotiations to extract concessions in other major EU policy files… in upcoming CAP Strategic Plans in exchange for softening their stance on the trade agreement… Countries such as France, Italy, and Poland, among the largest recipients of CAP funds… may push for compensatory mechanisms within the CAP, such as higher direct payments, rural development funding, or stricter sustainability standards for imports.”70 The strong opposition voiced by Polish and Lithuanian agricultural sectors in recent months—alongside the Baltic States’ joint call for reinforced protections under the CAP—suggests that countries in the region will likely leverage their position within the EU to secure favorable terms. Latvia has expressed support for the EU-Mercosur deal, despite concerns raised from the MOA, which may shape behind-the-scenes decision-making in Riga and Brussels. Further, potential concerns from Estonia’s farming sector could still shape its stance, particularly as all three Baltic States continue to prioritize national security in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. While smaller players in the broader EU context, the Baltic States—together with larger Poland—may still be able to leverage their strategic role in the Union’s stance against Russia to secure meaningful concessions for their agricultural producers. Beyond CAP concessions, it is possible that Poland may consider using its position on EU-Mercosur as leverage for Ukraine-related aid, though no related public demands have emerged yet. As such, Warsaw could potentially still link its support for the EU-Mercosur accord to broader issues like EU enlargement or military aid. The Baltics—smaller players on the EU stage—have not yet shown signs of pursuing similar demands, although this positioning may change if Warsaw secures clear concessions in regards to Ukrainian aid or succeeds in obtaining stronger protections against neighboring Russia.\nConclusion The EU-Mercosur agreement functions not just as a simple trade deal, but as an instrument to adapt to the shifting state of the global political and economic order. At a time when China has firmly supplanted the EU as Mercosur’s top trading partner, and the United States has turned inward with protectionist industrial policies, the EU faces a narrowing window to assert itself as a credible global economic actor. The agreement offers one of the last major opportunities for the EU to deliver a comprehensive, values-driven trade partnership with the Global South, reinforcing its role as a rule-setter in a rapidly shifting international order.\nChina’s rise in Latin America has been both swift and multidimensional. It now dominates Mercosur’s commodity exports and has extended its influence through infrastructure financing, energy investment, and high-level diplomatic engagement. These efforts are not confined to Latin America. China has actively expanded its presence in Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea region, investing in logistics, digital infrastructure, and port facilities across countries like Hungary, Serbia, and Latvia. While the Belt and Road Initiative has lost momentum in some parts of Europe, its economic footprint remains significant. For the EU, this dual front—China’s deepening ties in both South America and Europe’s periphery—raises the stakes for concluding the EU-Mercosur agreement as a signal of continued commitment to democratic, transparent, and rules-based economic integration.\nMeanwhile, the United States’ increasingly protectionist stance, seen in policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, reflects a broader turn toward industrial nationalism. These measures, while promoting domestic resilience, have introduced transatlantic trade tensions and created new obstacles for EU exporters. The absence of a U.S.-driven trade framework in Latin America further underscores the EU’s urgent desire to step in—not only to expand its own economic reach, but to prevent further erosion of the multilateral trade system that underpins its external strategy.\nThe EU-Mercosur agreement, therefore, carries stakes that reach far beyond tariff schedules or commodity flows. For countries like Germany, it offers a critical boost to industrial exporters. For agricultural economies such as France, Poland, and Lithuania, it poses real competitive challenges, but also opens the door to new markets. For the Baltic States, the agreement aligns with broader efforts to de-risk from Russian dependencies, secure new energy and fertilizer inputs, and support the diversification of global supply chains. In a multipolar world marked by strategic rivalry, the EU’s capacity to finalize and implement this agreement will serve as a test of its geopolitical maturity.\nWhether or not the EU-Mercosur agreement is ratified, it will serve as a key indicator of the EU’s ability to navigate a complex global trade environment marked by geopolitical competition, domestic pressures, and shifting alliances. As the bloc weighs these competing interests, the outcome of the ratification process will shape not only the future of EU-Latin America relations but also the EU’s broader capacity to respond to China’s growing influence and to engage with the Global South on its own terms. The final decision will reflect how the EU balances economic opportunity with political cohesion, strategic autonomy, and its evolving role in the global order.\nReferences 1 European Parliament Think Tank, “Ratification Scenarios for the EU–Mercosur Agreement,” (December 20, 2024), accessed June 30, 2025, EP Think Tank, https://epthinktank.eu/2024/12/20/ratification-scenarios-for-the-eu%E2%80%91mercosur-agreement/.\n2 Mariana Fleischhauer Corrêa da Costa and Pietro Regazzoni, Now or Never: Unlocking the Economic and Geopolitical Potential of the EU-Mercosur Trade Deal, unpublished manuscript, Fundação Getulio Vargas, 2025.\n3 Gabriel Araujo, “Brazil’s Lula Urges Macron to Back EU‑Mercosur Trade Deal,” Reuters, June 5, 2025, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-urges-macron-back-eu-mercosur-trade-deal-2025-06-05/.\n4 Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro, “New Import Safeguards Under Discussion to Secure Mercosur Deal, French Agriculture Minister Says,” Euractiv, June 17, 2025, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/new-import-safeguards-under-discussion-to-secure-mercos ur-deal-french-agriculture-minister-says/.\n5 Amandine Hess, \u0026ldquo;EU-Mercosur trade deal: Winners and losers in Europe,\u0026rdquo; Euronews, November 19, 2024, https://www.euronews.com/business/2024/11/19/eu-mercosur-trade-deal-winners-and-losers-in-europe.\n6 Amandine Hess, \u0026ldquo;EU-Mercosur trade deal: Winners and losers in Europe,\u0026rdquo; Euronews, November 19, 2024, https://www.euronews.com/business/2024/11/19/eu-mercosur-trade-deal-winners-and-losers-in-europe.\n7 France24, “Poland Joins France in Opposing EU–Mercosur Free Trade Agreement,” November 27, 2024, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241127-poland-joins-france-in-opposing-eu-mercosur-free-trade-agreement.\n8 European Parliament, Committee on Foreign Affairs Ordinary Meeting Hearing, June 23, 2025, 18:09, accessed June 30, 2025, https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/webstreaming/committee-on-foreign-affairs-ordinary-meeting-hearing_202 50623-1500-COMMITTEE-AFET.\n9 Polskie Radio, “Presidential Hopeful Vows to Defend Polish Farmers, Transport Firms,” March 31, 2025, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3503510,presidential-hopeful-vows-to-defend-polish-farmers-transpor t-firms.\n10 LRT, “Lithuania Is Against EU–Mercosur Trade Deal, Says Minister,” December 31, 2024, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2449997/lithuania-is-against-eu-mercosur-trade-deal-says-minister.\n11 European People\u0026rsquo;s Party (EPP), “Vaidere: Latvia Will Benefit from a Deal on World\u0026rsquo;s Biggest Trade Agreement,” December 6, 2024, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.eppgroup.eu/what-we-do/with-eu-countries/latvia/vaidere-latvia-will-benefit-from-the-biggest-trade-de al.\n12 Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “On 23 April 2025, the State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Andžejs Viļumsons, met with the non-resident Ambassador of Argentina to Latvia,” Facebook, April 23, 2025, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.facebook.com/LatvianMFA/posts/on-23-april-2025-the-state-secretary-of-the-ministry-of-foreign-affair s-and%C5%BEejs-/1131321939024697/.\n13 Rūta Rudzīte, Public Relations Specialist, Public Relations Division, Ministry of Agriculture of Latvia, email to author, June 27, 2025.\n14 Notes from Poland, “Polish Farmers Hold Anti-EU Protest in Warsaw,” January 3, 2025, accessed June 30, 2025, https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/01/03/polish-farmers-hold-anti-eu-protest-in-warsaw/.\n15 LRT, “500 Tractors in Vilnius: Lithuanian Farmers Gear Up for Protest,” January 17, 2025, accessed June 30, 2025, https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2177292/500-tractors-in-vilnius-lithuanian-farmers-gear-up-for-protest?srslt id=AfmBOorDFCttZ_BuNTY0BPvBQDd3KZ_QVbAQUej8Vyt8XNBrh2WuKQdt.\n16 European Rural Parliament, \u0026ldquo;About Us,\u0026rdquo; accessed June 30, 2025, https://europeanruralparliament.com/about-us/.\n17 Ignas Hofmanas, Minister of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Lithuania, accessed June 30, 2025, https://zum.lrv.lt/en/structure-and-contacts/management/ignas-hofmanas/.\n18 B.

Around a decade ago, ice caps and glaciers largely prevented exploration of Arctic territory; however, rising global temperatures that impact the Arctic around three times as much as the rest of the world has caused ice caps to melt, glaciers to dissipate, and permafrost to thaw, profoundly changing the physical landscape of the area while increasing maritime accessibility.1 Climate change in the Arctic raises concerns that go beyond the scope of global environmental stability: increased maritime accessibility in the Arctic has stimulated rising geopolitical concerns, specifically surrounding navigational rights and territorial claims. The widened economic and commercial opportunities that come from increased navigational capabilities are vast. Arctic nautical accessibility opens up the potential for more convenient shipping routes for Europe, Asia, and North America, as well as the opportunity for natural resource extraction. The economic imperatives for Arctic exploration are undeniable, and Russia has recently pursued an Arctic strategy heavily reliant on increased military activity, highlighting its aggressive approach to influence a region overwhelmingly inhabited by NATO-backed states. Russia’s militarization of the Arctic signals a stark shift in historical Arctic stability and regional cooperation. By adapting an aggressive approach to gain Arctic superiority, Russia not only poses an extreme threat to global security efforts, but it highlights an evident desire to undermine Western institutions through physical expansion and regional power projection.\nRussia’s Interest in the Arctic Russia’s historical interest in the Arctic dates back to the 15th century conquest of Siberia under Ivan the Terrible, a time of heightened interest in natural resources and the development of regional trading routes.2 Russia’s contemporary Arctic strategy remains reliant on economic imperatives, and its post-Soviet claims to Arctic territory have been bold and extensive. In 2001, Russia submitted a continental shelf claim essentially declaring around 1.2 million square kilometers of the Arctic to be Russian territory.3 This was met with extreme condemnation amongst Arctic states. Russia has continued its ambitious efforts to gain regional superiority over the Arctic despite its 2001 claim not being approved, especially when the Kremlin determined that gas and oil extraction would pave the way for energy superiority and “superpower” status within the global order.2 As of current, the Arctic Council reports that Russia holds around 24,150 kilometers of Arctic Coastline, which is 53% of the Arctic Coastline, ranging from the entirety of the Murmansk Region, northern parts of the Arkhangelsk Region, and multiple islands and archipelagos.4 Russia’s Arctic territories heavily influence its natural gas and oil industry, allowing it to remain as a large global producer of natural resources. Russia envisions its Arctic territory as a vast economic hub, and the commercial benefits generated by investing in innovation in the region is already evident. About 10% of Russia\u0026rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) comes from its Arctic Zone, as well as 20% of its total exports.2 As of 2024, 83% of Russia’s natural gas was extracted from its Arctic territory, and the country has invested in three large-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants since 2009: Sakhalin-2, Yamal-LNG, and Arctic LNG 2.5 Aside from its extraction industry, Russia also hopes to create a solidified Northern Sea Route that would essentially pave its northern coast into a maritime transit zone between Asia and Europe within the next decade.2 The NSR is only accessible during the summer months, but Russia hopes to invest more heavily in infrastructure to ensure a year-round operational period that could make it into a major global shipping route. Russia’s national economy is undeniably reliant on its Arctic Zone, enhancing Russia’s position in the global economy.\nRussia’s Arctic Strategy: Militarization Russia has begun to substantially invest in military infrastructure within its Arctic territories in an effort to support its navigational capabilities along the NSR. Rising global temperatures have created a new dynamic in the Arctic, one that is defined by increased naval accessibility that encourages maritime activity. Russia has turned towards a heightened military presence in an effort to deter foreign influence in its Arctic territory, signaling its desire to defend its interests in the region. Russia’s military strategy in the High North has taken many forms, notably beginning with the re-establishment of Soviet-era military bases and the development of new ones.6 Russia has around 14 airfields operational throughout its Arctic territory.6 A vast majority of these bases are focused on search and rescue (SAR) and resupply operations, but some of them provide defense capabilities. The Tiksi base, located in the Kola Peninsula, is an air defense and tactical aviation base equipped with Russian MiG-31’s and Su-25’s.6. The Severomorsk-1 and 3 base, located in the Murmansk Oblast, also contains tactical aviation, and the Vorkuta base in the Kimi Republic has Tu-22M3 supersonic strike bombers and an early-warning radar station.6 Russia has been consistently deploying troops to its Arctic Zone since 2013 as part of its Arctic Brigade, and troops are mostly tasked with monitoring activity along the NSR through surveillance and reconnaissance operations.6 Russia’s Arctic military strategy is also dependent on its Northern Fleet and Rosatom nuclear icebreaker fleet. The Northern Fleet is equipped with around 41 warships and 43 submarines, eight of the submarines being nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.7 In 2021, Russia officially proclaimed the Northern Fleet as its fifth military district, creating a centralized command force entirely focused on Arctic military operations.2 A military district in the Arctic is strategically important for the maneuverability of Russia’s military, allowing hubs of military infrastructure to quickly shift into a front in a wartime scenario. Additionally, Russia has gained superiority regarding its icebreaker fleet, currently equipped with 34 diesel-powered ships and seven nuclear-powered.8 Though icebreakers play a minimal role in military capability, they have allowed Russia to maintain a strong presence in the Arctic through increased maritime accessibility. Russia’s reliance on hard power in order to defend its regional interests emphasize a shifting level of tensions in the High North, as heightened military operations inherently pose a real or perceived threat to NATO-backed Arctic states.\nMilitarization as a form of Power Projecting Russia’s increased efforts of militarizing its Arctic Zone can be viewed as a form of power projection, especially in a time of escalating expansionist ideologies exhibited by Russian President Vladmir Putin. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 successfully highlighted Russia’s goal of weakening international order that has historically been held together by Western norms. Russia is the only non-NATO Arctic State, and it has consistently viewed NATO as a malicious conduit for Western influence into European political mechanisms.9 An Arctic that has become more accessible for navigation opens up an opportunity for substantial NATO influence in the region. Therefore, Russian military enhancement in the High North not only ensures that Russia can maintain tactical uniformity to Western institutions, but it emphasizes Russia’s desire to strategically undermine NATO’s capabilities through military and territorial power projections. This is extremely concerning, as prioritizing force and intimidation tactics in the Arctic has the potential to ultimately shift the historically low-tension atmosphere of the Arctic into a conflict zone, bridging the gap between Russian-NATO military capabilities.\nA militarized Arctic is less than ideal for not only the Arctic states, but for the wider global order as a whole. Russia’s heightened military presence reflects a broader effort to challenge an international order generally encouraged through diplomatic efforts, asserting control over territory through a military footprint that ultimately promotes a unilateral approach to Arctic governance that bypasses established norms and multilateral institutions. In a time of already unstable conditions between Russia and its European counterparts, a transition from general navigational activities in the Arctic to offensive operations would cause strenuous impacts on the region. Russia has made it extremely clear that it views NATO’s presence in the High North as a threat to strategic parity, but it should be the Arctic states best interest to ensure that the region does not become the next front for direct military confrontation.\nIn order to minimize the potential of Russia’s military posture allowing it to gain total superiority of the once low-tension atmosphere of the Arctic, the NATO-backed Arctic states should rely on efforts of diplomacy and mutual cooperation between all parties.2 Whether military escalation will increase to a dangerous level is entirely dependent on the steps that both Russia and the NATO-backed Arctic states take to mitigate the tensions of having two ideologically different entities inhabiting one region. If cooperation is prioritized, undermining a common contemporary theme of Russian aggression as seen in Ukraine, escalation in the Arctic will most likely be avoided. Furthermore, responding to Russia’s increased military posture in the Arctic with diplomacy rather than force would preserve regional stability while also upholding international norms, reducing the risk of heightened escalation through rule-based mechanisms in the Arctic Zone.\nCover photo: Olevs Nikers\nby [Vienne Abrahamian]\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/arctics/","tags":["Baltics","NATO"],"title":"Russia’s Rising Threat on Arctic Security"},{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"On May 4, 1990, the Republic of Latvia declared its independence from the Soviet Union, ending fifty years of occupation that began in 1940. Similarly, Lithuania and Estonia celebrated the 35th anniversary of their independence restoration in 2025 - Lithuania on March 11 and Estonia on March 30. As the Baltic States mark over three decades of sovereignty following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it becomes essential to analyze their evolving relationship with the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union’s successor state. Despite each Baltic nation possessing a unique historical trajectory, their experiences share many parallels, particularly in how they have navigated their relations with their former occupier.\n1990-1994 The relationship between the Baltic States and Russia has been marked by considerable tension since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Following the declaration of independence, the Baltic States were confronted with the presence of Soviet military forces who remained including personnel at the strategically significant skrunda-1 radar station. Estonia had between 12,000 and 14,000 Russian soldiers, and Lithuania was home to approximately 20,000 to 22,000 Soviet military personnel.¹ These forces remained stationed in the Baltic states until 1994, despite the official declarations of independence.\nThe withdrawal of Russian forces from the Baltic States occurred gradually, with Lithuania seeing the final pullout in 1993, followed by Estonia and Latvia in 1994. This marked a significant moment in the post-Soviet transition¹, signaling the definitive end of Russian military influence in the region. In the aftermath of this withdrawal, the Baltic States increasingly focused on consolidating their independence and reinforcing their commitment to Western integration, particularly regarding joining European institutions and securing membership in NATO.\nDespite the official end of Soviet military presence, Russia continued to assert influence over the region, especially through its criticism of the treatment of ethnic Russians of various international organizations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Baltic Sea States. These appeals often framed the situation in the Baltics as a human rights crisis², with exaggerated claims that policies towards Russians were akin to apartheid or that there had been instances of genocide.\nThe citizenship policies implemented by the Baltic States became a central focus of these criticisms. Lithuania, in contrast to its Baltic counterparts, granted automatic citizenship to nearly all residents, including ethnic Russians. However, Estonia and Latvia required passing a language proficiency test in the national language and apply for naturalization.² Russia utilized these differences as a key point in its diplomatic efforts, accusing the Baltic States of marginalizing ethnic Russians and creating a “second-class” status for them. While these tensions were particularly pronounced in Latvia and Estonia due to the larger Russian-speaking populations, Lithuania also faced criticism, albeit to a lesser extent, due to its smaller Russian demographic. Russia’s criticisms of these citizenship policies have continued to fuel diplomatic friction between the two sides, and the issue remains a point of contention.\n1995-2004 Between 1995 and 2004, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia continued to navigate complex diplomatic terrain in their relationships with the Russian Federation. This period was marked by the post-Soviet transition, the Baltic states’ pursuit of Euro-Atlantic integration, and Russia’s attempts to maintain regional influence. While each Baltic state faced unique bilateral challenges, common threads included disputes over border treatment, continued tensions surrounding Russian-speaking minorities, and geopolitical friction stemming from NATO and EU enlargement.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Russian troops in 1994, Latvia formalized its strategic orientation, the Foreign Policy Concept for 1995-2005.This identified EU and NATO membership as national priorities, alongside the pursuit of normalized relations with Russia.By 1997, Latvia and Russia had drafted a border treaty, including the Abrene region² annexed by the Soviet Union. While the Latvian government approved the draft in December 1997, Russia withheld its signature, leveraging the treaty to obstruct Latvia’s NATO and EU accession. ²\nThroughout the late 1990s, the Russian government and state-affiliated media consistently criticized Latvia’s treatment of its Russian-speaking population. Tensions peaked in 1998 with a bombing near the Russian embassy in Riga, which Russian authorities attributed to rising Latvian nationalism.² Annual commemorations of the Latvian Legionnaires and reforms to minority education became hot points in Russia’s efforts to delegitimize Latvia internationally.Between 1998 and 2004, Latvian-Russian relations stagnated, with Russia making periodic attempts to stir internal dissent and delay Latvia’s Western integration. Upon Latvia’s addition to NATO and the EU in 2004, Moscow effectively deprioritized bilateral relations.\nEstonia’s post-Soviet relations with Russia were similarly characterized by unresolved historical legacies and political trajectory. The withdrawal of Russian forces by 1994 did not settle underlying disputes, particularly concerning border demarcation and the rights of Estonia’s large Russian-speaking minority.\nAlthough a border treaty was initiated in 1996, it was never ratified due to disagreements over Estonia’s reference to legal continuity from its pre-World War 2 independence. Russia viewed this language as a rejection of Soviet legitimacy and used it as justification to delay ratification indefinitely.³\nEstonia’s requirement for language proficiency and loyalty oaths as prerequisites for citizenship became a focal point of Russian critique, with Moscow framing these laws as discriminatory. Russian media increasingly portrayed Estonia as a Russophobic state, with these narratives laying the groundwork for more aggressive cyber and disinformation campaigns in subsequent years.\nLithuania’s tensions with Russia were less ethnopolitical and more logistical and economic. Despite having a smaller Russian-speaking population, Lithuania’s strategic location positioned it at the center of key transit and energy disputes. Lithuania’s insistence on EU visa standards during accession negotiations clashed with Russian demands for unhindered transit to and from Kaliningrad.⁴ The compromise was a special facilitated travel document system, which, while accepted, added friction to bilateral ties. During this time, Lithuania also pursued energy diversification strategies and began investing in Western energy infrastructure and reducing reliance on Russian pipelines.⁴\nBy 2004, Lithuania emerged as one of the most vocal post-Soviet critics of Russian foreign policy. Its accession to NATO and the EU, like Latvia and Estonia, was viewed by Russia as a strategic loss. However, Lithuania’s firm commitment to transatlantic institutions allowed it to assert a distinct foreign policy identity.\n2005-2015 Between 2005 and 2015, relations between the Baltic states and the Russian Federation transformed from cautious coexistence to open confrontation. This period began with modest efforts at institutional engagement and culminated in stark geopolitical realignment.\nFollowing Latvia’s accession to NATO and the EU, Russia adopted a posture of “strategic indifference” toward bilateral ties. While Latvia emphasized multilateral cooperation through frameworks like the Council of the Baltic States, Russia viewed such institutions primarily as tools for asserting influence.⁵\nEconomic ties grew but remained fragile. Latvia interpreted regional cooperation as a mechanism for ensuring stability and prosperity, while Russia sought to leverage energy exports as geopolitical tools, fostering division within the EU. Russian foreign policy towards Latvia lacked coherence, moving back and forth between cooperation and policies that reflected suspicion, nationalism, and a refusal to confront Soviet-era legacies, such as denying the 1940 occupation.\nIn 2007, Latvia ratified a long-delayed border treaty with Russia.² The treaty’s ratification finally closed a decades-long chapter of legal ambiguity but did little to fundamentally change the tone of bilateral relations, which remained as “negative stability”.\nDespite deep-seated tensions, there were modest diplomatic overtures. In 2010, Latvian President Valdis Zatlers visited Moscow, signaling an interest in constructive engagement. The Latvian and Russian prime ministers met in 2013 at the Baltic Sea Forum, showing an ongoing economic dialogue.\nEstonia’s relationship with Russia was relatively quiet until the Bronze Soldier crisis of 2007.⁶ In April of that year, the Estonian government relocated a Soviet-era World War 2 monument from central Tallinn to a military cemetery, sparking violent protests by Russian-speaking residents and fierce condemnation from Moscow. Following the monument’s relocation, Estonia was hit with an unprecedented wave of coordinated cyberattacks targeting banks, ministries, and media outlets. These attacks, which are attributed to Russian actors, though not officially claimed, marked a new era in asymmetric state aggression. Estonia responded to this by internationalizing the issue through appeals to NATO and the EU, and by establishing the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence in Tallinn in 2009, positioning Estonia as a leader in cybersecurity.⁶\nThe 2007 Bronze Soldier crisis marked not only a cultural flashpoint but also the advent of cyber warfare as a strategic tool. Russia’s large-scale military exercises, such as Zapad 2009 and Zapad 2013, alarmed Baltic governments, who viewed them as rehearsals for invasion scenarios. These fears intensified after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, which became a watershed moment. All three Baltic states lobbied strongly for NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence, leading to the deployment of multinational battlegroups to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia in 2017.⁷\nMeanwhile, Russia’s policy of protecting “compatriots abroad” stoked tensions in Latvia and Estonia, where large Russian-speaking minorities were subject to controversial language and citizenship policies. The Kremlin’s rhetoric of framing these minorities as victims of discrimination was mirrored in state-sponsored media campaigns, contributing to fears of hybrid warfare and internal destabilization. In response, Baltic states tightened media regulations and expelled individuals linked to Russian intelligence operations.\nLithuania was particularly vulnerable to Russian energy dominance, which Moscow had exploited throughout the 2000s. In response, Lithuania built the KlaipėdaLNG terminal, which opened in 2014, to reduce reliance on Russian natural gas and energy. Lithuania also pushed for EU-wide energy solidarity, supporting the idea of an “energy NATO” to counteract Russia’s divide-and-conquer strategy within the EU.⁴\nThe Kaliningrad exclave, bordering Lithuania and Poland, remained a constant source of friction. Russian officials periodically escalated tensions by threatening to deploy Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad in retaliation for NATO’s missile defense installations in Europe. The region became a highlight in the broader East-West military standoff.⁷\n2016-present Latvia’s relations with Russia have undergone a sharp transformation since 2016, shaped by regional tensions, the invasion of Ukraine, and a push for energy and political independence. In 2018, the Latvian parliament condemned Russia’s actions during the Kerch Strait incident, which signaled early alignment with broader European criticism of Russian aggression. This foreshadowed a deeper rupture that would follow in 2022.\nAfter Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Latvia swiftly condemned the aggression, supported Ukraine with humanitarian and military aid, and imposed sweeping sanctions.³ Latvian authorities banned Russian state media broadcasts, declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, and restricted entry for Russian citizens holding Schengen visas. In January, 2023, Latvia formally downgraded diplomatic relations by expelling the Russian ambassador and recalling its own envoy from Moscow. Russia responded in kind.⁸\nEnergy independence also became a central focus. In February 2025, the Baltic states disconnected from the Russian electricity grid and fully integrated with the European power network, which was a decisive move in decoupling from Russian influence.⁹ Throughout this period, Latvia has steadily deepened integration with Western institutions like NATO and the European Union. While Russian authorities have never disclosed the full extent of support provided to organizations and individuals in Latvia, fragmentary information occasionally appeared in Russian-language local press, hinting at covert influence efforts.\nIn Lithuania, the invasion of Ukraine triggered a similar response. The government condemned the war, declared a national emergency, and requested NATO consultations under Article 4. Following revelations of Russian war crimes in Bucha, Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and closed the Russian consulate in Klaipėda. In retaliation, Russia withdrew its consent for Lithuania\u0026rsquo;s consulate in Saint Petersburg.\nLithuania’s Seimas declared Russia a terrorist state in May 2022, also identifying its actions in Ukraine as genocide. That June, Lithuania announced restrictions on the transit of sanctioned Russian goods to Kaliningrad via its territory, prompting diplomatic backlash.⁸ In September, it joined Latvia, Estonia, and Poland in banning most Russian citizens with Schengen visas from entry.\nIn the following year, Lithuanian authorities took further internal security measures, identifying hundreds of Russian and Belarusian residents as national security threats and revoking their residence permits.⁹ In October 2024, Lithuania formally denounced bilateral treaties with Russia and Belarus, including those related to taxation and legal cooperation. The energy shift in early 2025 marked the culmination of years of strategic divergence.\nEstonia also intensified its defensive posture. After the 2014 abduction of Estonian officer Eston Kohver by Russian agents, construction of a high-security border fence began with significant segments being completed by 2023.⁵ Estonia reacted strongly to the 2022 invasion by expelling Russian diplomats, banning state-controlled media, and designating Russia a terrorist state.\nDiplomatic relations deteriorated further in early 2023 when Estonia expelled 21 Russian diplomats and technical staff.⁵ Russia retaliated by expelling Estonia’s ambassador, effectively downgrading relations. In February 2024, tensions escalated further when Russia placed Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on a wanted list over the dismantling of Soviet monuments. The culmination of years of distancing came in February 2025 when Estonia joined the other Baltic states in disconnecting from the Russian grid and joining the EU electricity system.⁹\nConclusion Over thirty years since reclaiming their independence, the Baltic states have moved from reluctant coexistence with Russia to firm estrangement. What began as a fraught post-Soviet transition defined by troop withdrawals and disputes over citizenship has evolved into a relationship shaped by sharp geopolitical confrontation, particularly after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite the pressures of geography and history, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have charted a consistent course toward Euro-Atlantic integration, democratic consolidation, and strategic autonomy.These developments culminated in their recent energy decoupling from Russia. In doing so, the Baltic states have not only reasserted their sovereignty but have emerged as some of the most vocal and resolute critics of Russian aggression in Europe, underscoring their transformation from Soviet republics to frontline defenders of Western values.\nFootnotes:   Dmitri Trenin, Russian-Baltic Relations: A Decade after Separation, www.bmlv.gv.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/01_brs_04_rbr.pdf.\n  Nils Muižnieks (Ed.), The Geopolitics of History in Latvian-Russian Relations, 2011, www.lu.lv/fileadmin/user_upload/lu_portal/eng/news/The_Geopolitics_of_History_in_Latvian-Russian_Relations.pdf.\n  Toomas Hendrik Ilves, “Estonia: The Shadow of Moscow,” Politique internationale 116 (2007): 265–280.\n  Dovile Jakniunaite, “A Small State in the Asymmetrical Bilateral Relations: Lithuania in Lithuanian-Russian Relations since 2004,” Baltic Journal of Political Science 4.1 (2015): 70–93.\n  Richard Milne and Ben Hall, “The Baltic Balancing Act over the Threat from Russia,” Financial Times, 18 Apr. 2024, www.ft.com/content/2047a8d3-3b6b-485a-bcfa-f42ae8e352ee.\n  Vladimir Sazonov, Illimar Ploom, and Viljar Veebel, “The Kremlin’s Information Influence Campaigns in Estonia and Estonian Response,” TalTech Journal of European Studies 12.1 (2022): 27–59.\n  Vilius Ivanauskas et al., “Kaliningrad Factor in Lithuanian - Russian Relations,” Lithuanian Annual Strategic Review 15.1 (2017): 119–149.\n  “Latvia Lowers the Level of Diplomatic Relations with the Russian Federation,” Ārlietu Ministrija, www.mfa.gov.lv/en/article/latvia-lowers-level-diplomatic-relations-russian-federation.\n  Liudas Dapkus, “Baltic Nations Count Final Hours to Ending Electricity Ties to Russia,” AP News, 6 Feb. 2025, apnews.com/article/lithuania-baltics-russia-estonia-latvia-electricity-8a4da3b60cccf0c2fe7746496e941a71.\n  Cover photo: O.Nikers\nby [Lillian Mullins]\n ","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/russia_and_the_baltics/","tags":["Baltics","History"],"title":"Russia and the Baltics Since the Restoration of Independence"},{"categories":["Activities"],"contents":"The Baltic Security Foundation continues to support Ukrainian refugees in Latvia and the civilians in Ukraine.

Russia has claimed that Lithuania’s actions are a “violation of everything,” and has promised a response that is “not diplomatic.” In turn, Lithuania has argued that it is simply putting into practice the EU sanctions regime agreed upon as early as March, and that contrary to Russian claims, its actions will not halt all transit between Russia and Kaliningrad; rather, it will only stop the flow of sanctioned goods. Since then, Russia has made threats that could be interpreted to include the possibility of the use of force against Lithuania, but which do not necessitate this kind of action. Indeed, Russia has so far primarily stuck to the use of cyberattacks against Lithuanian government institutions, state businesses, and private businesses. Amid a backdrop of international fears of an expanded war with Russia and new developments this month in NATO’s strategic posture and membership, what all does this bode for the future in the Baltics, Europe, and NATO as a whole? Ultimately, it may simply boil down to a test of Western resolve. Will the West stand up to Russia, or back off fearing a conflict beyond Ukraine?\nIn its displeasure with this particular consequence of the EU sanctions regime, Russia has found an opportunity to test the mettle of Western nations. In making its complaints and its threats, Moscow’s aims are twofold: first, it can seek to influence target populations to believe that it is a victim of the same governments that those populations are, for various reasons, displeased with, effectively getting disgruntled voters in Western countries on its side, and second, it can attempt to intimidate the leadership of those countries into backing down. In this sense, Russia’s framing is much like its two-headed eagle – on the one hand, it presents itself as an innocent victim of the evil machinations of a decadent West, while on the other hand, it presents itself as a mighty Goliath ready to smash anyone who dares to oppose it. As such, it misrepresents both itself and its neighbor in order to ensure that Western responses remain mild enough for it to withstand. In truth, the sanctions regime as implemented in Lithuania will only block the transit of goods that are valuable to the war effort or in the export market. The sanctions target such items as steel, concrete, fossil fuels, and alcohol, but do not prevent ordinary passenger travel or the transit of most basic consumer goods. This comes in stark contrast to Russia’s early claims that Lithuania was blocking all transit, and which framed the decision as a unilateral one.\nMeanwhile, there are already some European proponents of making concessions to Russia on the issue of transit to Kaliningrad. Allegedly, some EU officials believe that Russia has greater leverage on this issue, and therefore a compromise needs to be reached. This compromise is said to be in the works at the EU level, with a document prepared by the European Commission, and is backed by Germany, though the details at this juncture remain unclear. Nonetheless, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has already come out in favor of such a compromise, saying that EU sanctions should not apply to goods in transit between Russia and Kaliningrad. In framing the issue as one of intrastate commerce, Scholz appears to have forgotten that these goods must still travel through another sovereign nation. Scholz’s statement should come as no surprise, however, as he has been consistently conciliatory in his approach to Russia. Nonetheless, it is concerning that one of the major power players in Europe is willing to publicly take Russia’s side on this issue and to urge the EU to back off. Even worse, it appears the EU is in agreement with Germany and is willing to make Lithuania the scapegoat. Lithuanian officials, however, are in favor of staying the course, arguing that backing down will only embolden Russia. Petras Auštrevičius, a representative for Lithuania in the European Parliament noted that “if we retreat… Russia will see this as a challenge.” In other words, if Western countries back off on the sanctions, Russia will see opportunities to further intimidate them into a milquetoast policy towards its war in Ukraine.\nSpeaking to this broader context of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Western response has been mixed, and has not been strong enough. Notably, several Central and Eastern European nations, including the Baltics, have been among the leaders in aiding Ukraine to the best of their limited capabilities, and the UK has largely been the boldest leader among the allies to the west. Unfortunately, most other countries have been cowed into a position of providing aid that is limited in its usefulness out of fear of escalation or, in some cases, a strategy of realpolitik which views Russia as more important for their own aims. As such, the overall response has been to provide enough weapons and supplies to keep the Ukrainians fighting, but not enough to help them win. In essence, the strategy of many Western countries has been to pretend to help Ukraine while in reality only providing enough aid for it to be destroyed more slowly and expensively. This response has enabled Russia to stay in the fight, and will create a longer war of attrition, costing many more lives and much more money, but political expedience has prevented more impactful aid.\nDespite this, the NATO Summit in Madrid and the new strategy put forth this year do provide encouraging news that the alliance is getting more serious about the threats posed by Russia. After last year’s shift towards greater complacency and mission creep, this year’s focused, succinct, and largely more practical strategy is overdue, but welcome. The allies have agreed to focus on improving the defense and deterrence posture, including force mobility, command and control structures, and a greater forward presence. Russia is now no longer viewed as a potential partner, but as the single greatest threat and the object of the alliance’s focus militarily. As a result, the allies have agreed to bolster the forward presence of troops and heavy equipment on the Eastern Flank, including the Baltics. Notably, Britain has agreed to send an extra thousand troops and one of two new aircraft carriers to Estonia, a very important contribution not only to the existing ground forces in the Baltic theater, but also for a long neglected and often outright nonexistent forward presence in the maritime domain. These contributions come after years of an inadequate forward presence in the Baltics, which would have likely been overrun before reinforcements of troops and supplies could come in. Departing from a strategy of “lose then retake,” will be critical for defending the Baltics; between the commitments made at the Madrid Summit and the improvements outlined in the 2022 Strategic Concept, it appears that NATO is finally taking the Eastern Flank seriously.\nWhile NATO and the EU appear to be going in opposite directions at the moment, and while individual nations’ responses are varied, one key piece of the strategic picture remains: Russia is mired down in a costly, resource and manpower consuming war in Ukraine. It is neither close to winning nor to losing, and it will likely remain that way for some time yet. It is greatly encouraging to see NATO getting serious about preparing for the possibility of future conflict, improving its defense and deterrence posture with a show of strength rather than seeking to appease Russia by limiting its ability to fight if attacked in the East. Yet, the EU appears instead to be ready to cave in the face of Russian threats in mortal fear of escalation. It is precisely this kind of timidity that emboldens Russia, and indeed, timidity in the West provided Russia the perfect time to attack Ukraine again. That, however, is not the only flaw in the EU’s approach to resolving the Kaliningrad transit fight. The primary issue is that, contrary to many dramatic hot takes predicting that this could spark World War III, Russia’s entanglement in Ukraine leaves it in a position where it is unlikely to be either bold enough or desperate enough to open up another theater of operations. It is not winning big, nor is it losing big, making such an operation essentially a pointless suicide. Russia’s decision to stick to hybrid methods, namely cyberattacks, to punish Lithuania further demonstrates that this particular issue is not big enough for Russia to send men and tanks to another front over products it can also send to Kaliningrad by ship. Rather, it is testing the limits of Western resolve to see what it can get away with and what it can potentially reverse.\nNATO has, at last, demonstrated commitment to its mission. The EU and national governments in the West, however, continue to waver. As a result of this wavering, Russia will continue to be emboldened, will continue to push at buttons to see what it can get in its favor, and will continue its deadly war of attrition in Ukraine with little to stop it. If this trend continues, Russia will seek more and more, and Western nations and the European Union will have the ignoble distinction as its enablers. That is the most dangerous thing. Russia is unlikely to attack Lithuania if the sanctions regime remains in place – it simply is not worth the trouble. On the contrary, it is far more likely to attack when it believes its opposition is weak. NATO is moving in the right direction. The EU and national governments should follow suit.\nCover Photo: Russian transit train between Moscow and Kaliningrad.

It is no longer a matter of if, but when. Some pundits have been quick to point out that Russia already invaded Ukraine in 2014 and has been an occupier since then. This is true, but short of inventing some other barbarically cumbersome turn of phrase or vague milquetoast nonsense that fails to capture the urgency of the situation, an invasion is perhaps the best word available to describe what is on the horizon. After a year of major foreign policy blunders by Western countries and successful stage-setting by Russia, Ukraine finds itself surrounded by Russian forces from nearly all directions. For Kyiv, dark days and difficult decisions lie ahead. For the West, key questions remain unanswered. Can Western nations and Western institutions put up a strong and effective response? For Russia, key questions have already been answered. All that remains is to cross the Rubicon.\nDiplomatic efforts have failed. They were doomed to fail. After the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the decision to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 to placate wayward Germany, a couple failed trial balloons for policies of appeasement and capitulation, and a host of other issues, the Kremlin had no reason to take the Biden administration seriously. Instead, Moscow upped the ante, issuing ultimatums that it knew the United States and NATO could not meet lest they lose their credibility. If the West stands firm, Russia has invented for itself a pretext for war à la Austria-Hungary to Serbia in World War I or Rome to Carthage in the Third Punic War. If the West falters, Russia has an even stronger impetus to pursue its imperial ambitions in the face of further degraded deterrence.\nMuch of the problem for Western diplomatic efforts was a failure to understand the nature of the Putin regime. Among the most ridiculous failures were appeals to “building back better” in Russia. The assumption that the Putin regime is nigh upon collapse if it fails to fix the economy and end the suffering of average Russians has been proven incorrect time and again, yet it continues to draw followers. This idea can be forgiven in those who do not understand Russian history or the tendency of Russian society to favor security over risks and liberty to the point of enduring some of the most miserable conditions in history. But to square up with Russia, one must first understand it. The idea that invading Ukraine (again) would be against Russia’s interests is ludicrous, wrongly imposing the interests of democratic, Western nations on an authoritarian and kleptocratic regime. The Kremlin’s interests perennially have very little to do with the welfare of the Russian people. Instead, Russia seeks to revise its Cold War defeat and rise from the ashes as an imperial military super power, as has been Putin’s dream from the beginning.\nLikewise, diplomatic efforts failed because the West has been bargaining from the weaker position. Without a coherent policy towards NATO besides appeasing Germany to “repair” the U.S.’s supposedly broken alliances, the Biden administration has signaled its apathy towards the needs and interests of the Eastern Flank. Though the Biden administration talked a big game about being tough on Russia and supporting NATO, its first year proved the opposite. Strong words without strong deeds to back them up will inevitably be mocked. This incoherence has spilled over into the question of how to approach the ongoing crisis as well. From official U.S. support for peace on the terms of the Minsk Accords to the now thankfully abandoned idea of reducing the force posture in Eastern Europe in exchange for a Russian drawdown, the blunders Washington has made have emboldened Russia, hurt Kyiv, left many scratching their heads in bewilderment, and still others scrambling to somehow put lipstick on this pig.\nFurther, efforts of diplomacy have been plagued by a mentality of pursual of peace at all costs. An excessive fear of escalation has, as should be expected, emboldened Russia and made escalation all the more likely. A peace on the basis of the Minsk Accords would be tantamount to abandonment – Ukraine could once again be placed under Russian control, unable to determine its own future. Likewise, the idea of reducing the force posture on NATO’s eastern flank would have been a massive capitulation, a gift that Moscow likely would not have thought possible to achieve so easily. Had this policy remained a possibility, Eastern Europe would have been left incredibly vulnerable. Even if Russia were to draw down for a time, Moscow’s history of reneging on its agreements should tell us that as soon as it saw fit to take the opportunity, the Kremlin would elect to break its promises and violate the sovereignty of its neighbors again. At no point should any of these policies have been on the table – the cost of the peace offered by these is outweighed by the unlikelihood that they would satiate Russia’s appetite for empire. Indeed, this theoretical and likely short-lived peace would come at the cost of abandoning like-minded, friendly countries in Eastern Europe, a betrayal reminiscent of Münich in 1938.\nNow, as it stands, two rounds of talks this month in Geneva between U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have proven completely inconclusive. Neither side has budged, and the Biden administration evidently understands that it has been unable to dissuade the Russians from making new incursions into Ukraine. Nonetheless, it holds to the same vague threats of crippling sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. There is currently no clear evidence that these threats have had any effect on Moscow’s decision making, aside from perhaps encouraging Russia by way of their implicit weakness. Not only do these threats of sanctions contain no specifics to scare the Kremlin, they do not really target anything Russia values more than rebuilding its empire and asserting its right to control its neighbors. Furthermore, in an embarrassing gaffe, President Biden intimated that a “minor incursion” would not incur such a harsh penalty as a major one. Whatever that means, it nevertheless shows weakness and incoherence from Washington, which will only encourage Russia’s adventurism.\nMeanwhile aid pours into Ukraine. God bless Kyiv if it can make effective use of it all, but for all the well-intentioned and inspiring optimism that surrounds commentaries projecting a difficult fight for the Russians and even going so far as to predict a Ukrainian victory, the sober analyst must point out that the mismatch between Russia’s forces and Ukraine’s is going to be difficult to overcome. Further, this aid may be too little too late, especially as the Ukrainian forces are not experienced with much of the equipment and systems that are being gifted them. Ukraine urgently needs greater support beyond just supplying helicopters and missiles. It needs the training to operate them. It needs the manpower to hold off a more numerous enemy. It needs the money to pay its troops. And it needs all these things urgently. Is there time to achieve what needs to be done? No matter what, the West must muster up the will, lace up its boots, and get to work to help out its friend without delay. This must be done not only out of a sense of duty to freedom, sovereignty, and self-determination built into friendship with Ukraine, but out of an understanding of history which tells us that sacrificing one country to the whims of another will only embolden the aggressor and lead to a broader, more devastating war. Timidity now will only lead to more war in the future, something no one wants.\nRussia is presently moving troops and supplies from across its multiple military districts towards Ukraine, setting up snap exercises in Belarus, deploying over 140 warships for exercises across “all areas of responsibility,” increasing submarine activity in the Black Sea, and has conducted a major cyber-attack on Ukraine’s electrical, gas transmission, and financial systems. None of these things portend Moscow backing down. The writing is on the wall. How the West responds will have consequences that reverberate for generations.\nCover Photo: Olevs Nikers\nBy Matthew Thomas\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/major_russian_invasion_of_ukraine_imminent/","tags":["Russia","Ukraine"],"title":"Major Russian Invasion of Ukraine Imminent"},{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"From the Baltics, to Poland, to Ukraine, and even outer space, Russia has recently been testing Western resolve on numerous fronts. Perhaps most pressing of the myriad issues in recent news are the recent Russian military buildup around Ukraine and Belarus’ exploitation (with at least tacit Russian support) of migrants from the Middle East to wage hybrid war on Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. Moving forward, how the West responds to these issues will play a major role in Russia’s course of action. As it tests the waters with various provocations, Russia will get a clearer picture of what it can and cannot get away with. With more understanding of the field of opportunity, Russia will then make decisions on which objectives to go after. If the West wishes to limit Russia’s adventurism, it will need to stand firm with a credible show of strength across multiple issues. Weakness and disunity will only encourage the Kremlin to keep pushing the envelope at the expense of its neighbors.\nThe Belarusian migrant crisis began in late spring/early summer and has recently flared up again this November with a greater influx of migrants being brought not just to Lithuania, but to Poland and Latvia as well. This has been Minsk’s idiosyncratic means of conducting hybrid warfare against its neighbors, which have spoken out most strongly against President Lukashenka and his regime. This effort likewise benefits Moscow, which seeks to destabilize Eastern Europe and sow divisions within Western institutions such as the EU and NATO. As Lukashenka’s Belarus becomes more isolated and outcast from the rest of the world, it is forced to rely more and more on Russia. Being under Russia’s thumb, Belarus would not likely be able to continue its weaponized human trafficking operation without the Kremlin’s approval. But, in this area, Russia stands only to gain. Those who would condemn Russia’s support for Belarus are already against Russia anyway; meanwhile, Russia can afford to let Lukashenka wreak havoc on their mutual enemies by manufacturing a humanitarian crisis. In turn, this then adds to negative press against countries like Poland and Lithuania in addition to new opportunities to plant disinformation about the treatment of migrants in these countries.\nThis situation creates headaches beyond Poland and the Baltics as well. Within the EU, Poland is not a popular member. It regularly goes against EU consensus in domestic policy, and the EU has frequently sought to punish Poland for it. Meanwhile, Latvia and Lithuania are not particularly influential in the EU, and are also unpopular with the likes of more powerful member countries such as France and Germany because of their relentless opposition to Russia. By fomenting a migrant crisis in Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, Belarus is forcing Brussels to either help EU members to defend their national sovereignty or to leave them in the lurch, testing the boundaries of what the EU will accept seeing done to members that the most powerful members view with disdain. For Russia, this disunity is a key weak point to exploit, so it is content to let Belarus enact its vengeance on its neighbors. By testing the EU’s willingness to stand in solidarity with members that are not high on the pecking order, Russia can see what sort of response it can expect to its actions. The same principle applies in NATO: is the collective defense agreement credible? How far can Russia push the boundaries of what the alliance will tolerate? Will NATO stand firm or appease?\nUkraine constitutes another key battleground in Russia’s ongoing war against the West. Ukrainian and Western intelligence reports alike have concluded that Russia is making preparations to attack Ukraine, possibly around the beginning of next year. As Russia builds up its military presence along Ukraine’s borders, it is issuing ultimatums to the West, which are more or less impossible to meet without complete surrender to the reversal of the post-Cold War order and the principles of self-determination and liberty. As the list of demands grows, Kremlin gaslighting and propaganda portray the West as the serial aggressor and seek to pin blame on Ukraine, NATO, the United States, and Western countries writ large. As Russian activities and rhetoric become more and more brazen, the West faces a key test. Will it stand up to Russian aggression and help Ukraine, or will it back down and let Russia have what it wants?\nRecent events do not bode well for Ukraine either, nor for Western leadership. Capitulation by the United States on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany earlier this year was a gift to the Kremlin. Likewise, the most recent sanctions on the project are largely toothless, designed more to save face than anything, and inclusion of a sanctions package on Nord Stream 2 in the Defense Appropriations Bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate. This project, when it does eventually become operational, will allow Russia to completely bypass Ukraine for gas transport to Europe, allowing for greater energy blackmail against Kyiv and still deepening Europe’s dependence on Russian gas. In turn, this dependence in Europe will provide significant leverage for Russia to get favorable political outcomes in European capitals.\nAnother key indicator of bad things yet to come is the U.S. position on the Minsk Accords. In his recent meeting with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken affirmed the Biden administration’s position that the full implementation of the Minsk Accords was the best path forward, though such a path would be a complete betrayal of Ukraine in favor of Russia. Implementing the Minsk Accords would force Ukraine to grant special status to territories held by Russian puppets. In exchange for these concessions, Russia has promised peace. Therefore, advocating implementation of the Minsk accords puts the seal of approval on the legitimacy of Russia’s actions in the Donbass, where it was, in fact, the aggressor. This is peace at the end of a gun – peace by surrender. Neither side has implemented the peace process, nor should Ukraine expect Russia to uphold its end of the bargain anyway – especially not if it gives in. Unsurprisingly, Kyiv’s complete acquiescence to the Minsk Accords, with no such binding agreement on Moscow, is one of Russia’s key demands. To make matters worse, the U.S. position on the Minsk Accords follows the recommendation of a much lambasted article by Samuel Charap which argued in favor of appeasing Russia. Many have speculated that the article was done in coordination with members of the Biden administration to preemptively justify a policy of appeasement, reaching a deal with Russia at the expense of Ukraine. If this is, in fact, true, then Kyiv’s position is only getting worse.\nIndeed, Joe Biden already has a poor track record on Ukraine. When Joe Biden was Vice President under Barack Obama, he was instrumental in that administration’s decision to deny lethal aid to Ukraine. He likewise allegedly threatened to cut off funding to Kyiv if the Ukrainian government did not fire the prosecutor investigating corruption in the dealings of a natural gas company at which his son was a member of the board. Since beginning his own administration, Biden has used diplomatic means to coerce Ukraine into staying quiet about Nord Stream 2.\nOn a more positive note, and to its credit, the Biden administration has rebuffed Russia’s demands that NATO cease enlargement and give up any plans to allow Ukraine or Georgia to join the alliance, holding that only NATO members can decide who gets to join NATO. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has announced that the alliance\u0026rsquo;s policy is the same. But, though that particular part of the ultimatum is impossible to accept on principle, it may very well be put into practice regardless given opposition to Ukraine’s accession from within the alliance anyway. Given this situation, Ukraine cannot rely on any security guarantees from NATO. Since it is merely a partner to NATO and not a member, it is not a party to Article 5’s mutual defense agreement. Furthermore, it is unlikely to receive any real help fighting. It can certainly expect a deluge of aid, but most of that aid will prove to be too little, too late, absolutely useless, or any combination of the three. Likewise, there is no indication yet of any Western response besides more sanctions and political restrictions, which are unlikely to deter Russia.\nAs Russia seeks to reverse the post-Cold War order, it is looking for windows of opportunity to play the aggressor with impunity. The West needs a strong, unified, and credible deterrent to prevent further adventurism by Moscow. That strength, unity, and credibility need to be demonstrated in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine. In all these places, Russia’s actions are unacceptable and must be countered. Disunity on the migrant crisis and appeasement on Ukraine will only embolden Russia to go after more that does not rightly belong to it.\nCover Photo: Olevs Nikers\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/russia_testing_western_resolve/","tags":["NATO"],"title":"Russia Testing Western Resolve: How will the West Respond?"},{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"Earlier this month, the Estonian Center for Defense Investment (ECDI) announced the purchase of Blue Spear 5G SSM land-to-sea missile systems from Israel. With a maximum range of 290 kilometers (approximately 180.2 miles), the Blue Spear missile system can reach targets across both the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea, and can also be used to strike both moving and stationary targets at sea in all weather conditions, day or night. Likewise, it can autonomously navigate to its target zone, and zero in on targets on its own once it gets in range to do so. This procurement constitutes a considerable improvement to defense capabilities in the maritime domain for Estonia, and signals a crucial acknowledgement of the need for reorientation to coastal defense.\nLike the rest of the Baltic States, Estonia’s coastline has previously been exceedingly vulnerable to Russian aggression. There has been little any of the three could do to stop Russia from projecting power into their port facilities, territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, or other littoral areas, including grey zone hybrid activities and surprise offensive military action. This situation has been exacerbated by a condition of sea blindness, wherein the overarching focus on land-based deterrence has resulted in neglecting the maritime domain. Furthermore, Russia’s anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities in Kaliningrad and a lack of forward naval presence in the Baltic Sea created a strategic conundrum for NATO and the Baltic States at sea. The Baltic States and NATO have also lacked continuous situational awareness in the Baltic Sea, making aggression all the easier. Against this backdrop, Estonia’s purchase of Blue Spear anti-ship land-to-sea missiles is certainly welcome news.\nAs Asko Kivinuk of the ECDI notes, Estonia’s focus is now shifting to naval capabilities following the long standing efforts to improve the land forces. The new anti-ship missile systems, which should be arriving by the end of 2023, will greatly improve Estonia’s ability to defend its territorial waters and counter Russian threats at sea. These systems can easily reach targets across the entire length and breadth of the Gulf of Finland, in theory creating an area denial zone there. Likewise, they can reach across the breadth of the Baltic Sea, thereby allowing Estonia to seal off sea routes between St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad, as well as denying access to its own littoral areas. By adding these capabilities, along with the procurement of new naval mines in the summer, Estonia is creating in effect the possibility for an A2/AD area of its own against surface vessels.\nThe next step, however, is to obtain the means to make such a strategy truly achievable. In order to put the new missiles to good use, Estonia must develop greater surveillance and targeting capabilities at sea. As aerospace and defense correspondent for Forbes, David Axe, notes, for the missiles’ autonomous navigation technology to be practical in any way, the missile must know where its target zone is. In order for that to happen, the personnel programming the missile’s trajectory must know where the target zone is. That requires a complete picture of the maritime domain, which, as CAPT Bill Combes (U.S. Navy, ret.) points out, should be a continual reality, 24/7. This same necessity has been recognized by the commander of the Estonian naval forces, Jüri Saska, noting that such a picture is essential to making both timely and effective decisions. Thus, enhancing surveillance and targeting capabilities at sea should be Estonia’s next project, which may require greater cooperation with Sweden and Finland as well.\nFor all three Baltic states, and NATO as a whole, this new development is a critical step forward. By developing the means to deny access to surface vessels in the Gulf of Finland and northern Baltic Sea, Estonia can prevent Russia from utilizing Saint Petersburg’s port and naval facilities for aggressive action, leaving only Kaliningrad in play. By doing that, Estonia will cut off one key option for supplying the exclave. Furthermore, it can prevent amphibious landings on its own territory, and prevent a full blockade of all three Baltic States. This will make it all the more difficult for Russia to fully cut off the Baltics and squeeze them into capitulation.\nBy filling in crucial gaps in coastal defense capabilities, Estonia is leading the way forward for a more complete deterrence posture. Latvia and Lithuania should seek to follow its example. Even if they do not seek to obtain anti-ship missile systems, the other two Baltic states should begin shifting their focus to sea as well, while continuing to maintain what they have achieved with their ground forces. Developing effective capacity to defend against threats in the maritime domain will provide a more complete and balanced deterrence posture and help prevent the contingency of a Russian Anaconda Plan against the Baltics. For the Baltics, naval advancement is long overdue, and apathy about the maritime domain must give way to better strategic thinking. Baltic Security Foundation is invested in being part of this effort, through research and publications both past and future. Hopefully, Estonia’s apparent shift in priorities will inspire greater urgency in the other two to put an end to sea blindness and challenge Russia’s ability to maintain a favorable status quo.\nCover Photo:\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/estonia_new_anti-ship_missile/","tags":["Naval"],"title":"Estonia’s New Anti-Ship Missiles: Crucial Naval Capability and Overdue Strategic Shift to Sea"},{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"For international observers, military exercises are a key litmus test of a country’s strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, they reflect that country’s view to the strategies of its supposed opponents. In that sense, this year’s Zapad (“West”) exercises conducted in Russia and Belarus were no different. They revealed Russia’s perceptions of the way the NATO will fight, given the still relatively unlikely event of war between the two. Likewise, the exercises remained highly scripted as in the past, and the scenarios involved were largely the same. But, there were a number of key differences as well. For example, Zapad 2021 featured a much greater multinational component than before, with seven countries represented, including India. The increase in foreign participants demonstrates a growing military diplomacy component to the exercises. Likewise, preparations for the exercises began earlier in the spring, testing key military logistics capabilities, and a there was a Russian military presence on the ground in Belarus as early as July. Further, these exercises were much larger in scope in terms of both manpower and equipment than the more sensationalized 2017 exercises. But, perhaps the most important difference between 2017’s Zapad exercises and this year’s iteration is the geopolitical situation for Belarus and the changes in force integration that have resulted from Minsk’s new position.\nWith President Aleksandr Lukashenka’s regime in Minsk backed into survival mode, now unable to toe the line between Russia and the West, Belarus is more willing to host larger Russian contingents than before, and is being pushed towards ever greater political and economic integration with Russia in keeping with the Union State Treaty. As a result, Zapad 2021 featured a far greater focus than before on integrating Belarusian forces into Russian-led structures. Previously, the Zapad exercises were labeled as unilateral “strategic command-staff exercises,” but this year, they were framed as “joint strategic exercises” with Belarus, reflecting that change in integration. Likewise, interoperability between Belarusian and Russian forces was a key focus of this year’s exercises, and a number of joint-training centers have been established for Russo-Belarusian military cooperation on Belarusian soil since late 2020. Notably, Russia seems to view itself at a disadvantage compared to NATO in the air domain, and much of the joint training and military upgrades in Belarus are related to that perceived deficiency.\nAir defense capabilities are a key component to nearly all the notable joint-training centers being established in Belarus, from Baranovichi to Hrodna. Agreements between Belarus and Russia regarding combined air controls and training centers have moved forward since late last year, and in early September, ahead of the timeframe for the exercises, Russia deployed S-300 missile defense systems and several Su-30 fighters to Hrodna, near the border with Poland and Lithuania. These systems should not, however, be viewed purely defensively. They can perform offensive functions, and indeed, Russian military strategy prefers a sort of “pre-emptive defense,” wherein Moscow seeks to coerce its opponents into backing down by inflicting heavy costs up front. This strategy has often been referred to as “escalate to de-escalate,” and reflects the offensive nature of the Russian defensive posture.\nLocating these assets at Hrodna presents another challenge for NATO in the Baltic theater. Hrodna is only 15 km (9 mi) east of the Polish border and 30 km (19 mi) south of the Lithuanian border, very close NATO’s strategic nightmare, the Suwałki Gap. As the only land corridor between the Baltics and the rest of NATO, the narrow Suwałki Gap (which forms the border between Poland and Lithuania) is crucial to the strategic calculus of both NATO and Russia. Placing these air defense systems at Hrodna gives Russia greater capacity to close off the Suwałki Gap, denying access to the Baltics by land and complementing Russia’s anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) posture in air and maritime domains as well.\nNew developments in the air domain do not end there. In addition to serving as a tool for greater force integration and interoperability, joint exercises between Russia and Belarus since late 2020 have also focused on and served as the impetus for modernizing the Belarusian air force. These upgrades have included deliveries of Su-30 fighters to the Belarusian air force, as well as S-400 ground-based air defense systems. Because of their long range, the S-400 systems should not be viewed purely defensively either, just like the Su-30s and S-300s. The new S-400 systems in Belarus could easily be used offensively against targets in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in the event of armed conflict, and would likely be used in such a capacity.\nAs Belarus becomes an international pariah and is forced more and more into the fold of Moscow, it is inexorably pushed towards greater political, economic, and military integration with Russia. Where once Lukashenka resisted the idea of Russian military presence on Belarusian soil, he is now open to the establishment of joint bases. While the Russian presence is, for the time being, not a permanent one, greater force integration and interoperability between Russian and Belarusian forces will have long-term effects. Furthermore, by way of the Union State treaty or some other political intrigue, there are no guarantees that Russian forces will only be present on a temporary basis for even the foreseeable future. Indeed, if the Kremlin wants to establish a permanent Russian military presence in Belarus, there is not much Lukashenka can do any more to stop it. As a result, Belarus easily becomes an even more crucial component for the Kremlin’s strategic calculus, and indeed, Moscow is clearly working towards turning Belarus into a military asset rather than a liability.\nWhat then, does all this mean? Does Russia seek to seal off the Suwałki Gap and invade the Baltics? Not so fast. As BSF President Olevs Nikers points out, it would be easy for Russia to seal off the Suwałki Gap from Belarus, but war between Russia and NATO remains unlikely. Some perspective is needed here: Russia’s actions should not be taken purely offensively or defensively. Russia has long sought to create buffer zones between itself and its perceived enemies. Belarus sits at the doorstep of the so-called “Smolensk Gate,” a historic invasion route from the Northern European Plain towards Moscow. Controlling Belarus, then, provides a larger buffer to the Russian heartland. Likewise, since Russian strategy prefers a form of “pre-emptive defense,” control of Belarus provides a greater means to quickly establish Russian control over other areas, sealing those off from NATO. In other words, if Russia did decide to go on offense and attack the Baltics, control over Belarus would be an ace for the Kremlin. That, of course, is not very reassuring.\nUltimately, one key message is clear. Recent developments regarding force integration and interoperability, as well as modernization of the Belarusian air force and the placement of key Russian air defense systems at Hrodna are clear indicators that Russia seeks to establish the capacity to seal off the Suwałki Gap and take offensive action on the Baltics if it deems necessary. This capacity could serve a dual purpose: first, to deter perceived NATO aggression, and second, to eliminate targets in the Baltics and Poland in a first strike escalation to coerce NATO to capitulation. As a result, NATO must then prepare for such a scenario, understanding that whether Russia intends to use its new capacity or not, it does intend to be able to. If it does, the consequences for NATO will be grave, and for the Baltics, fatal.\nCover Photo: Service members bearing the flags of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan marching during ceremonies at Obuz-Lesnovsky in Western Belarus.

In retaliation to the sanctions placed on his regime following the forced grounding of a passenger airliner to arrest journalist Roman Protasevich, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenka promised to force Europe (and in particular, Lithuania) to deal with drug smuggling and migrant flows on their own. Aside from Lukashenka’s claim to have been stopping migrants and smugglers in the past, the statement gives clear indication of intent to weaponize migration and the flow of contraband. Furthermore, the sheer volume of migrants, the coordinated way in which they are arriving, and the actions/inactions of the Belarusian border guards point to an overt policy whereby Minsk is encouraging illegal migration through Belarus to Lithuania.\nIllegal migration poses a number of difficult problems for Lithuania. In this magnitude, it places a great strain on Lithuania’s already limited resources to accommodate the migrants, from manpower to basic necessities such as food. Further, it can be difficult to trace the background of some migrants, especially those from volatile parts of the Middle East. With many of the migrants coming from northern Iraq, a recent hotbed for terrorist activity, there is the potential that violent extremists may be among those compatriots genuinely seeking a better life in Europe. But, above all else, this crisis could ultimately become a humanitarian issue, as migrants risk health and safety to be trafficked into the EU and once there, face a system that is not prepared to accommodate so many people. The bottom line is this: the Lukashenka regime is attempting to apply pressure, if not outright blackmail, the EU and Lithuania in particular by manufacturing a humanitarian crisis, facilitating smuggling, and creating opportunities for propaganda against Lithuania and the West writ-large.\nThis strategy represents what appears to be Lukashenka’s idiosyncratic approach to hybrid warfare. Hybrid warfare can be loosely defined as the use of often unconventional tactics that fall short of conventional war (i.e., armed conflict), which are often hard to attribute and can fluctuate in intensity according to an actor’s long and short-term goals. It is used for the purpose of achieving political outcomes favorable to an actor in a country (or countries) that said actor deems an adversary. Flooding Lithuania with migrants itself is not an act of war in the traditional sense, but Lukashenka clearly sees himself at war with Lithuania and is weaponizing trafficking to retaliate against Vilnius’ hardline stance against his regime. This has already fed into information warfare as well, as Belarusian state media have published disinformation pieces alleging beatings and other threats of violence against migrants by Lithuanian border guards.\nAs Lukashenka becomes more and more of a pariah in the West, and draws nearer and nearer to Russia, his tin-pot dictatorship develops greater geopolitical consequence. Already in close cooperation with Moscow in military affairs, Lukashenka is a key ally for Russia in the Baltic neighborhood. Further, as Lukashenka becomes more and more reliant on Moscow to prop up his regime, he will be forced to continue making progress on the realization of the Union State treaty, which will result in greater economic and political integration with Russia. As interests merge and Moscow gains greater control over Minsk, Lukashenka’s Belarus becomes less a roaring mouse and more of a genuine strategic headache.\nThis brings us beyond the nuts and bolts of stopping the flow of both human and drug trafficking in the broader context of regional security for the Baltics. If Belarus gone rogue is ultimately under Moscow’s thumb, a number of different scenarios must be considered with regard to defending the Baltic States and deterring aggression. Each of these presents a different idea of the underlying motives and likelihood for attack, understanding that Belarusian territory will certainly come into play in both the ground and air domains in the event of conventional conflict.\nUnder the first strategic framework, the Baltics’ deep integration within NATO and the EU, among other Western institutions, as well as their binding security agreements and the presence of NATO enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) battalions in their territories, will prevent Russia from choosing to attack. The consequences are just too high for Russia, and it knows that in the long-haul, it is not a contender to beat NATO, at least on paper. But, the question arises – is it credible? Will NATO really come to the aid of the Baltic states? If so, that may be the beginning of World War III. Are NATO and the West more broadly willing to meet that challenge, or will weak leadership prefer a policy of appeasement?\nThe second scenario sees Russia adopting an aggressive, opportunistic approach against the Baltics. The U.S. recently gave the Kremlin a major geopolitical gift by removing the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and allowing the project to move forward to completion. This was done in a short-sighted attempt to placate Berlin and improve U.S.-German relations with complete disregard for American, Ukrainian, or broader European interests. Indeed, Germany gave almost nothing in exchange for the deal. After the United States’ capitulation to Germany and Russia’s whims on Nord Stream 2, it allegedly threatened consequences for bilateral relations with Ukraine if Kyiv complained too loudly. This gives Russia good reason to believe that the West is a paper tiger. As such, Moscow can take advantage of the fact that many of the ongoing improvements to security, whether in terms of personnel, infrastructure, or weapons systems, are incomplete. Given a less than optimal security situation in the Baltics, and appeasement on Nord Stream 2, Russia may well prefer to take a first-strike approach and attempt to escalate the conflict to the point that the West would be blackmailed into backing down. This challenge will test the credibility of NATO – will it back down and give Russia what it wants, or stand together and fight?\nFinally, the third option observes an attitude of complacency, if not outright irresponsibility, on the part of Western leadership vis-à-vis the Russian threat. As such, the Kremlin could opt to buy more time to catch the West unawares, or, more likely, to continue wearing down Western resolve through a long game of escalated hybrid warfare. State capture, wherein an actor achieves such a level of control over crucial sectors of the economy that it can corrupt the political elite, is a key element of Russia’s broader hybrid warfare strategy. If Russia can continue to break the West’s resolve and co-opt its leadership (e.g. “Schröderization”), then it faces a much weaker opponent later on down the line, with far less credibility or will to fight.\nThis brings us back to Belarus. The Lukashenka regime is undoubtedly now rushing headlong into the Kremlin’s fold, and as such, should be viewed in that broader context. Conflict with Belarus ultimately will mean conflict with Russia, and vice-versa. Therefore, the migrant crisis Lithuania faces today is not just the petty vengefulness of a tyrant, nor just a temporary headache for Vilnius to sort out, but a key litmus test for Western leadership. As such, it is important to remember the bigger picture. Strategic thinking at all levels will be necessary to keep focused and improving in order to secure a future for freedom and sovereignty in the Baltics.\nCover Photo: The Belarusian-Lithuanian border.

This occurred smack in the middle of U.S. President Biden’s much touted trip to Europe, and overall received little media attention. A Google search of the summit produces primarily NATO press releases, the odd news article here or there (but only from mainstream yet highly partisan sources, fringe outlets, and little else), few analyses, and a preponderance of pre-summit anticipatory articles from news sources and think tanks alike. The clear majority of search results are dated within the weeks leading up to the summit, and little has been said about it since. Why? Because ultimately, this summit marked a return to business as usual, and aside from the inclusion of China on the threat radar and the ambiguous position on Afghanistan, very little was particularly newsworthy. However, the NATO summit does bear importance for the Baltic States, particularly against the backdrop of Western relations with Russia, and therefore it is worth unpacking here.\nIn its 79 paragraphs, the post-summit communique contains all the resolutions member states agreed to this year. The bulk of these resolutions can be classified as ongoing commitments from previous summits and/or agreements made in advance of the summit. Others broaden the alliance’s objectives, such as addressing the threat from China, the NATO 2030 program, and combating climate change. Still others suggest ideas for reinvigorating the defense and deterrence posture, revamping the command structure, promoting societal resilience, and combating cyber threats, to name a few. Yet these offer few specifics with regard to any action plans to accomplish these goals, though they do indicate that such plans exist, or are at least being worked on, often in the form of fashionable buzz-words such as “whole-of-government approach” and “tailored and structured.” As of now though, the communique offers little to suggest that these agreements can be put into practice, fitting a broader theme of “all talk and no action.”\nWith regard to the Russian threat, and relations with Moscow more broadly, the communique contains about a dozen paragraphs that specifically mention Russia on a range of issues from protracted conflicts (e.g. Transnistria and the Donbass) to nuclear nonproliferation. Several of these simply outline various instances and forms of Russian aggression, while others call for Russia to reverse course on one policy or another, and others state NATO’s resolve to counter Russian aggression. Among these, NATO members resolved to continue the enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) posture in the Baltic States and Poland. Further elaboration on that point can be found further down in paragraph 34, wherein the communique touts “continued improvement” through aligned plans and greater force integration between the eFP battlegroups and national defense forces. Aside from the reassurance that NATO seeks no confrontation and is not a threat to Russia, nothing else is said on eFP.\nThe majority of the commitments salient to the Baltic States’ defense against Russia are within the category of old agreements reaffirmed. These include commitments to improved military mobility, force structure, military strategy vis-a-vis defense and deterrence and warfighting, cyber defense, societal resilience and civil preparedness, etc. In these, there is little to no information in the communique pointing towards updates to these agreements, with the exception of progress reports on measures already taken, such as the opening of a Euro-Atlantic Centre for Resilience in Romania. Defense expenditures and investments are another key area wherein previous commitments were reaffirmed at this summit. The communique notes that ten member states are expected to meet the two percent of GDP requirement on defense expenditures this year, while “nearly two-thirds” of the allies are expected to meet that requirement by 2024. Short of the statement that “we can and must do more,” however, nothing is said to address those that will not reach that requirement, such as Germany, which plans to reach it by about 2030. Failure to meet these agreements is a demonstration of disunity among member states, and as such, is of greater consequence than it may initially appear.\nThe concept of unity itself has been a key theme for this year, and many have heralded the return to unity in NATO since the Biden administration took office. Yet, on issues such as NordStream 2, the Normandy Process (which NATO leaders unwisely pledged to support), and a reset in relations with Russia, France and Germany represent powerful forces whose aims are antithetical to those of much of the rest of the allies. Likewise, Paris and Berlin have successfully blocked a pathway to membership for both Ukraine and Georgia, with this year’s resolutions maintaining that status quo. Indeed, each of these positions advantages Russia at the expense of a NATO partner in Ukraine and, in some cases, allies within Central and Eastern Europe. Predictably, Russia sees Paris and Berlin as weak links in NATO’s unity and resolve. Furthermore, given the Biden administration’s strategy of appeasing Germany, as seen in removing sanctions on Nord Stream 2, the Kremlin has no reason to believe that NATO cannot be undermined from within. After the NATO summit and Biden’s summit with Putin in Geneva, Moscow is already saber rattling and testing NATO’s unity and resolve in the Black Sea with aggression against British, Dutch, and American ships.\nFor the Baltic States, this summit should be viewed with a touch of concern. There is very little new that impacts their security, outside of recognizing the threat from China. Vis-a-vis defense and deterrence on the alliance’s eastern flank, almost all agreements simply reaffirmed what is already taking place. Other agreements reflect a sense of mission creep - the heads of state may all have altruistic motives in agreeing to fight climate change, but is that something a defensive military alliance should be focusing its attention on? Where does that fit within NATO’s purpose? Finally, the much heralded return to unity has not really benefited them in any concrete sense, and in some respects, undermines their interests and the interests of like-minded allies. Indicators seem to be pointing to a return to an era of complacency within the alliance, and the Baltic States should start preparing for that contingency. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should all be asking, “Is this good enough?” “Can we effectively deter and defend against Russian aggression?” “Should we be doing more than we already are?” Pledges of support are only as good as the real support given, and the Baltic States must remain vocal about the threats they face in order to receive the support they need. Now is the time to focus on the eastern flank, not abandon it.\nCover Photo: National flags outside NATO Headquarters in Brussels.

This step is considered crucial for successfully exiting the Soviet era BRELL agreement, in which the Baltics’ power grids are controlled by Moscow. Exiting BRELL is a major component of the Baltics’ overall strategy not only for energy security, but for their national security broadly.\nUnder the BRELL agreement, the Baltics have been synchronously connected to the Integrated Power System/United Power System (IPS/UPS) grid with Russia and Belarus since the end of the Soviet period. This arrangement has left Moscow in a position of control over the power grids of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, in addition to Belarus, Kaliningrad, and northwestern Russia. Given Russia’s history of using energy supplies as a tool of political coercion, this leaves the Baltic States’ power grid vulnerable to Moscow’s machinations.\nFor the last couple decades, the Baltics have focused on reducing their reliance on Russian energy as part of their overall security strategy. For them, independence from Russian supplies represents reduced leverage Moscow has over their political systems, enhancing their overall security. In the gas sector, this work is already in advanced stages. The Baltics broke Gazprom\u0026rsquo;s monopoly in the gas sector through infrastructural development and greater integration with the Nordic and continental European markets. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania continue to pursue that strategy of integration in programs such as the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) and the Three Seas Initiative, ending their relative isolation in the energy market. In that vein, the Baltics’ synchronization plan with the EU in the power sector follows a similar strategy of obtaining energy independence from Russia and ending their isolation from the rest of Europe, and builds on previous interconnection projects with the Nordics.\nUnder the 2018 synchronization agreement with the European Commission, the Baltics are scheduled to synchronize their power grids with Continental Europe via a link between Lithuania and Poland (known as the LitPol link), as well as an undersea cable if deemed necessary, by 2025. The arrival of the transformer in Lithuania this month was part of the development of the LitPol link, and will facilitate the flow of electricity from Poland to Lithuania and northward to Latvia and Estonia. By ending their isolation from the West in the power sector, the Baltics will bolster their energy security through interconnection with friendly countries, rather than Russia. However, Russia fears that this will cause Kaliningrad to become isolated from the rest of the IPS/UPS grid and has historically opposed any Baltic exit from BRELL. As a result, the Baltics should expect Russian malign activities related to desynchronization from the IPS/UPS grid as they synchronize with Europe. Indeed, indicators suggest that in order to prevent harm to Kaliningrad, Belarus, or Northwestern Russia if Moscow decides to conduct an attack on the Baltics’ power supply, Moscow is preparing its infrastructure to be ready, even to the point of possibly exiting the agreement preemptively.\nWith the process of exiting BRELL and integrating into the Continental European grid set to be completed in 2025, the Baltics should take the opportunity now to improve both the physical security and cyber security components of their critical energy infrastructures. In the maritime domain, physical cables, linkages, and other onshore and undersea components are largely unprotected On land, the situation is largely the same; critical energy infrastructure is poorly guarded, if at all. Likewise, system operators are insufficiently prepared for cyber attacks or blackout scenarios. Given Russia’s tailored use of hybrid warfare to target individual nations’ weaknesses, its regular use of energy supplies for blackmail and coercion, and its opposition to Baltic integration with the West, the Baltics need to improve the security of their infrastructure as well as their supply.\nAchieving energy independence in both the gas and power sectors is a massive leap forward for Baltic security, writ large. It will greatly reduce Moscow’s leverage against the Baltics, and will prevent Russia from disrupting critical supplies of gas and electricity. This promotes overall security to ensure Baltic society and government cannot be worn down through energy blackmail. But, if critical infrastructures are not secured, that work will only be half done. If Russia can still disturb the systems that bring gas and electricity into the Baltics, it does not matter where that gas or electricity came from. As the Baltics draw nearer to achieving a full exit from BRELL and synchronization with Europe’s power grid, the time is now to invest in securing critical infrastructure.\nCover Photo: LitPol Link electricity connection with Poland to Alytus.

Surrounded on nearly all sides, it faces a potential crisis of existence, as Moscow sees an opportunity to take on yet more ambitious objectives against its hapless neighbor. Unfortunately for Ukraine, nothing guarantees its security, and it is grossly, obscenely outmatched by its adversary. What exactly Russia intends to do remains a mystery, but one thing is clear: Russia plans to attack Ukraine. When, where, how, how far – these things can only be speculated, but Russia is undeniably gearing up for war.\nObservations on Land Between March and April, 110,000-150,000 troops (estimates vary) massed near the Russian border with Ukraine, as well as in Crimea. This is well beyond the number used for the annexation of Crimea or for the invasion of the Donbas. Many were pulled from units beyond the Urals, and the railway system accommodated the movement of large volumes of heavy equipment. On paper, this was called a “readiness check,” but the reality is that the Kremlin frequently uses the pretense of “exercises” to conduct major operations. Further, the deployment lasted for approximately five weeks, significantly longer than Russia usually conducts training exercises. It is unlikely that there is nothing to see here, even given the highly publicized drawdown of forces. Notably, much of the equipment brought to one of the deployment sites, 17 kilometers south of Voronezh, is being left there, ostensibly for the annual Zapad exercises.\nThe units deployed are also significant. Among these are field hospitals, signals units, electronic warfare, air defense batteries, tank and rifle battalions, multiple rocket launcher batteries, and short-range ballistic missile batteries. Taken as a whole, there is at bare minimum a clearly signaled threat to Ukraine, if not an outright indication of intent to attack. Furthermore, the locations of the key deployments, in Crimea, Rostov district, and Voronezh district were all within quick striking range, and in the case of Rostov district and Voronezh district, were near a high speed rail line constructed under the auspices of Russian Railways (RZhD), but with heavy involvement of the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD). Not long after the railway’s completion in 2017, military movements along the line were reported, and analysts noted the railway’s critical importance for military logistics near Ukraine and the occupied territory in Donbas.\nDespite the drawdown of forces, Ukraine remains in an extremely precarious position. Firstly, Russia has demonstrated its capability to rapidly deploy over 100,000 troops from across the country, including from beyond the Urals, to the border. Secondly, the assets and equipment staged near the border remain there, as do some of the personnel. Lastly, the land component pales in comparison with what is happening in the maritime and air domains.\nObservations at Sea Russia’s intentions are more clearly observable at sea. Russia has announced new maritime exclusion zones around Crimea, as well as the Sea of Azov, which it has effectively annexed as an internal body of water. Moscow has successfully transferred naval assets from the Baltic Sea Fleet, the Northern Fleet, and the Caspian Flotilla into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and many of the ships are manned with marine forces trained to conduct offensive amphibious operations. Naval aviation assets are present to provide support for these marines. With the Sea of Azov effectively blockaded, and the waters around Crimea closed off, Russia has Ukraine in a tight spot by sea. Furthermore, Western naval assets in the region are insufficient to prevent Russian attack, and given the conditions placed on non-Black Sea littoral states by the Montreux Convention, the role of Turkey, recently angered by Washington’s recognition of the Armenian Genocide, will be a primary question mark in the coming weeks. Notably, Western countries have shrunk back in the face of Russia’s saber rattling in the Black Sea, seeking to avoid escalation. The United States canceled plans to send two destroyers into the Black Sea, removing that critical asset of power projection from the region.\nPaul Goble, writing for the Jamestown Foundation, makes three key observations:\nFirst, the Caspian Flotilla was used alongside FSB vessels for Russia’s aggressive activities in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait during the summer of 2018, wherein it attacked three small Ukrainian vessels passing through the strait. With the deployments of March-April, the Caspian Flotilla is back in theater\nSecond, the aforementioned FSB vessels are now directly supporting the Black Sea Fleet.\nThird, the forces in the Sea of Azov can easily be used to support a land invasion of Ukraine.\nIndeed, the presence of the marines on board these vessels in the Sea of Azov and around Crimea appear to signal intent to conduct amphibious landings at some time in the future. It is ultimately just a question of when.\nObservations in the Air In creating its area denial zones around the Crimean peninsula and the Sea of Azov, Russia has historically placed great significance on the air domain. This time is no exception. Moscow has been updating its anti-missile and anti-aircraft systems, and is presently focusing considerable effort to upgrade its anti-drone capabilities. If the Kremlin is planning an attack on Ukraine, the anti-drone systems will be a crucial component to preserving its other assets, as the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been acquiring Turkish Bayraktar combat drones, which are among the most dangerous assets in Kyiv’s arsenal. In March, the Russian naval forces in the Black Sea conducted exercises to simulate anti-drone operations. However, Russia’s anti-missile and anti-aircraft upgrades may be more daunting, and are perhaps no less clear a signal of intent.\nRussia has been busy upgrading its early detection radar systems, and will be replacing its old systems on Crimea with the new Yakhroma early-warning missile defense radar this year. Notably, this same system is also planned for Russia’s area denial posture in Kaliningrad, and when installed in both locations will give Russia vastly improved intelligence gathering and early warning capabilities over not only its own territory, but over Belarus and Ukraine as well. Beyond radar, Russia is establishing anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities on Crimea that mirror, or even exceed its capabilities at Kaliningrad. This reflects a clear strategic decision to focus on the use of missiles and related assets in the Ukrainian theater, possibly targeting crucial military infrastructures such as airfields and headquarters buildings. Indeed, between missiles, drones, heavy lift aircraft with troops, and electronic warfare capabilities, Russia is poising itself to be able to knock out Ukraine’s air defense system and infrastructures.\nFinally, electronic warfare capabilities round out the layers of Russia’s area denial posture. Moscow uses multiple onshore and aircraft-mounted signals jamming systems to diminish the capabilities of foreign radar systems, radio communications, and other critical systems for general awareness and intelligence gathering alike. Through the use of electronic warfare capabilities, anti-missile and anti-aircraft capabilities, and anti-drone capabilities, Russia intends to make Crimea into an area-denial zone. Yet, as we can see with the A2/AD posture on Kaliningrad, these capabilities can easily be used for offensive operations, and indeed likely will be. Furthermore, Crimea has received such special attention from Moscow in developing its local A2/AD posture there that it may even rival Kaliningrad in strength.\nWhat Has Putin Achieved? Russia under Putin is an opportunistic actor. Moscow acts when it senses weakness. While the press tout the putative achievement of the drawdown of land forces, Russia’s other moves in the maritime and air domains are ignored, the assets that remain where land forces deployed are ignored, and the lessons from Moscow’s military logistics success are ignored. As Glen Grant, senior expert for Baltic Security Foundation, points out, Moscow has successfully:\n•\tSealed off the Sea of Azov,\n•\tIntimidated the U.S. into removing its naval assets from the region,\n•\tBlackmailed the U.S. into holding a summit, something that has not occurred since about a year and a half into the Trump administration,\n•\tRehearsed en-masse military mobilization on the Russian rail system,\n•\tAnd conducted dry runs for heavy-lift aircraft and parachute teams, amphibious assault forces, and artillery battalions.\nRussia has done all this and more while applying yet more pressure on Ukraine - and on the West as to how to respond. Furthermore, assets remain in place near the Ukrainian border and on Crimea, and the naval forces have not been drawn down at all.\nHow Will the West Respond? At this critical juncture, it is clear that it is less a matter of if Russia will attack Ukraine, but when. Russia knows the track record of the United States in Ukraine, and that Biden, while more or less in charge of President Obama’s foreign policy was extremely hesitant to confront Russia and refused to give lethal aid to Ukraine. Russia knows that Germany and France, as opponents to Ukrainian integration into NATO and key European interlocutors with Russia will more soon sacrifice Ukraine than lose their special relationship with Moscow. Indeed, Berlin and Paris have already been crucial in drafting plans for peace that disadvantage Ukraine and give Moscow most of what it wants. As Ukraine is not a NATO member, and is valued less than Moscow by some Western members, NATO will not come to Ukraine’s aid. Some Western countries will likely provide aid, but not in the form of anything useful. As Grant points out, Ukraine can ask for, and perhaps expect to receive, ammunition, supplies, and even some equipment. But it cannot expect to receive help fighting, nor can it expect to receive enough of the aid it receives, nor can it expect to receive it on time. Furthermore, Grant notes, the Ukrainian army is unprepared to use much of the equipment it could receive, having little to no experience or training with foreign weapons systems and maintaining an outdated structure of command. As such, this aid is wasted and almost completely useless, but it is all that can be expected of Western leaders who will pat themselves on the back for what they have given to Ukraine and bloviate about their solidarity with Kyiv as they let Moscow run roughshod over it. This presents Moscow with an opportunity to strike, and strike it probably will. The West is woefully unprepared for this crisis, and may talk tough, but will demonstrate its apathy in what action it takes.\nCover photo: Russian military vehicle in Crimea 2014. Ilya Varlamov.

Again."},{"categories":["Policy"],"contents":"U.S. President Joe Biden has claimed that Nord Stream 2, the controversial Russo-German pipeline project, is a “bad deal for Europe” and has stated his administration’s opposition to the project. At face value, that would appear to be a rare continuity with the previous administration, but a deeper dive into the various perspectives in Washington reveals a much more complicated position. Despite spoken commitments to the bipartisan sanctions regime instituted by the Trump administration, it appears that the Biden administration is ready to wash its hands of the issue and move on.\nSecretary of State Anthony Blinken has reaffirmed the “bad deal for Europe statement” and reportedly informed German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas that all entities engaged in the construction of the pipeline could face sanctions. Blinken himself stated that the pipeline “divides Europe, exposes Ukraine and Central Europe to Russian manipulation and coercion, [and] it goes against Europe’s own stated energy goals.” Yet, he did not outright state to Maas that any entities involved in construction of the pipeline would receive sanctions. Rather, he stated that the administration will “make a determination on the applicability of sanctions.” This leaves the door open for inaction. Likewise, Blinken has repeatedly emphasized in talking points that the project is “virtually complete,” a factual statement, yes, but one that signals the administration’s disinterest in stopping the pipeline.\nOther officials within the administration have made similar vague statements that hint at the possibility of not applying sanctions to all construction activity on the pipeline. State Department spokesman Ned Price notes that “we are always looking at pipeline activity that would be sanctionable, so if we see activity that meets that threshold we are prepared to follow the law.” This would appear to indicate a process of selectively applying sanctions on some entities, but not others, and there is no explanation of what exactly that threshold is. Notice as well that the administration is “prepared to follow the law,” referring to the existing sanctions package – this language signals that the administration’s stance is not one of strong opposition, but rather of simply doing what is required. Also notable is one statement by an unnamed senior administration official who says, “we’re between a rock and a hard place.” The English idiom used here sums up the Biden administration’s attitude towards the project: on the one hand, it opposes the project on principle, and for the right reasons, but on the other hand, it is so committed to conciliation with Germany that it appears willing to waver on Nord Stream 2.\nFurther statements seem to indicate that the administration is simply buying time on the issue. In an official statement, Blinken notes that the State Department is “tracking efforts to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and is evaluating information regarding entities that appear to be involved.” Yet, when the State Department published its report of entities involved in the project, it neglected to include any European companies involved in the construction of the pipeline for new sanctions, instead focusing on Russian vessels. Bloomberg notes that this decision “reflects a political calculation by Secretary of State Antony Blinken not to challenge Germany over its support for the pipeline.” Yet, as opponents point out, this position of conciliation with Germany risks alienating other key allies, such as Poland and the Baltic States. By targeting only Russian entities, and avoiding applying the law across the board to all entities involved in Nord Stream 2, the Biden administration is putting forth a façade of being tough on Russia while enabling the project to continue. This Potemkin village may fool some in the press, but Russia is taking note that it can meddle in European affairs and the U.S. will be hesitant to take action. Indeed, after a 15 month hiatus, construction is resuming on Nord Stream 2, and Gazprom board chairman Viktor Zubkov has announced that construction will be completed this year.\nOthers have taken note of the Biden administration’s unwillingness to actively pursue sanctioning European actors involved with the project. Russia has primarily used shell companies, detours, middlemen, and odd quantities and pricing to dodge sanctions. By following a similar pattern to money laundering, Russia has managed to obfuscate its activities on paper, yet these tactics are still in and of themselves not particularly sophisticated. Indeed, the use of shell companies opens an actor up for more sanctions. Surely the United States is not fooled by this activity – so what is going on? Ultimately, Russia’s success in dodging sanctions in this way underscores Washington’s unwillingness to address the issue. As Nikos Tsafos of the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies points out in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Biden administration is likely to turn a blind eye in order to leave room for compromise with Germany.\nCompromise between the U.S. and Germany on Nord Stream 2 has already been suggested before. The German ambassador floated the idea in February, giving the completed pipeline a new role as leverage between Berlin and Washington on other issues. Notably, the German Ministry of Finance is in contact with the United States on the issue of sanctions and sanction threats, but the content of these talks is confidential. Some have suggested a number of different cooperative agreements Germany could make in exchange for completing Nord Stream 2 unhindered, such as investments in energy projects in Central and Eastern Europe, investment in “green energy” projects in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, or possible trade agreements, but what exactly will come of any negotiations with Berlin remains to be seen. It would appear that the pattern the administration is setting so far will allow Germany to make very little sacrifice for having the privilege of completing the project, if Washington will indeed take the route of diplomatic compromise.\nIn the U.S. Congress, however, there is some bipartisan pressure to keep fighting Nord Stream 2 more actively. Some Senators among both parties noted after a classified briefing with Blinken on March 11 that is unclear if the administration is willing to act quickly enough to prevent the pipeline’s completion. For opponents of the project, however, there is still some possibility that the sanctions regime could still be enforced. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has placed a procedural hold on confirming crucial Biden administration nominees in order to gain leverage to force the administration to act. Senator Cruz has stated his commitment to maintaining the hold until all portions of the sanctions law are enforced fully. Further, the bipartisan sanctions law itself has overwhelming support among both parties; yet, among Biden’s Democratic Party, there are senators, such as Chris Murphy (D-CT), who continue to urge that sanctions only be applied to Russia. Other Democratic Senators, such as Bob Menendez (D-NJ), knowing that the Biden administration is only pursuing sanctions against Russian entities rather than enforcing the law across the board continue to claim that the administration is doing what is necessary to stop it. Few Democrats, such as Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a co-author of the sanctions bill with Senator Cruz, have been willing to urge the administration to “expeditiously” halt the construction of the remainder of the pipeline. This situation leaves a mixed impression for opponents in Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, there is bipartisan support for the sanctions package in the U.S. Congress and significant political leverage being applied through the Senate confirmations process; on the other hand, members of President Biden’s party, including those who support the sanctions, have been largely unwilling to urge a stronger approach. Whether or not efforts to force the administration to enforce the sanctions law across all entities involved in constructing Nord Stream 2, including European ones, will be successful remains to be seen. So far, it is clear that the administration is unwilling to step on Germany’s toes, and is only willing to half-heartedly attack the problem.\nSo far, the Biden administration is quietly deviating from its predecessor’s position on Nord Stream 2. At the present time, it appears that the administration is pretending to be tough on Russia, while in reality caving to Germany, which is in turn tantamount to surrendering to Russia by allowing Moscow to complete the project. For the Baltic States, Poland, and the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, this position should be deeply concerning. Not only does it allow for the process of subversion to continue in Germany and open the door for greater energy coercion in Europe, it also signals that the Biden administration is not truly committed to protecting the security of the region. By capitulating here, the Biden administration is unintentionally signaling weakness to Russia. As an opportunist in aggression, Moscow is already taking note.\nCover Photo: A pipelayaing vessel for the Swiss firm Allseas working on Nord Stream 2 in 2018.

They help shape a more robust understanding of the situation at hand and can prepare countries for the otherwise unexpected. As much of Europe celebrates Joe Biden taking the helm in the United States after the much despised Trump administration, it is worthwhile to take a step back and question whether or not that enthusiasm is really merited. As such, this paper puts forth an unabashedly contrarian viewpoint for the sake of an enriched understanding of the world as it may be going forward, lest the Baltics be caught off guard in the broader optimism of their European counterparts. So what can the Baltics and NATO expect from the incoming Biden administration? It may not be as rosy as it sounds.\nGroupthink is a common organizational problem that leads to poor decisions. It occurs when alternative viewpoints go unheard and mainline opinions go unchallenged. In the sea of voices in the foreign policy world as well as the media, there are few to be found who do not present Joe Biden as the savior of NATO from the destructive Trump administration. But is there truth to that idea? Is it grounded on sound analysis with any basis in historical fact, or is it a product of the post-election euphoria that has swept much of Europe and America? Will policy match rhetoric, and will it be effective? If the Baltics and NATO are to be prepared for what lies ahead in the next four years, these questions need to be asked, and answered.\nLet us begin with the premise of Trump’s destructiveness. Does this assumption hold water? Trump’s rhetoric was often abrasive, and he was regularly critical of NATO allies’ failure to meet expectations, particularly in the category of defense expenditures. It may be noted that in the first half of his presidency, Trump made a number of statements regarding Montenegro that might have suggested a lack of understanding of the defensive nature of the alliance. In that same time frame, he had a disastrous summit with Putin in Helsinki. It was during this time that Trump made many of the statements praising Putin that would later haunt him. But what did we see in his presidency as a whole?\nTensions with Germany over Berlin’s pursual of Nord Stream 2 and its recalcitrance on defense expenditures continued, and Emmanuel Macron of France called NATO “brain dead,” but, as Heritage points out, overall conditions were improving. NATO members have been consistently adding to their investments in defense, and non-U.S. allies have increased their investments by approximately $130 billion since 2016. Likewise, the U.S. invested $5.9 billion in the European Deterrence Initiative in 2020 alone over a timeframe that saw continued U.S. investment in Europe’s defense. Further, the United States currently has more forward presence forces than before, and recently signed a bilateral agreement with Poland on mutual defense. V Corps has been reactivated, with a forward headquarters in Poland. While the United States arranged to pull troops home from Germany, it continually added troops to more forward positions nearer the Russian threat. Finally, the United States committed to investing in the Three Seas Initiative, which would bolster Central and Eastern Europe’s economic and energy security, while also making critical improvements to military mobility through infrastructural improvements.\nWhile the Western Europeans loathed the Trump administration, many in Central and Eastern Europe who looked beyond the abrasive rhetoric and transactional nature of the administration and saw the manifold improvements to their own security across several domains held a more nuanced view. Thus, the idea that Trump was nothing but a destructive force to the alliance does not hold water. Rather, the problem for NATO was a combination of complacency from within, and intentional division from without by adversaries such as Russia and China. Indeed, by the second half of his administration, Trump was convinced that there was to be no repairing relations with Russia, and that Moscow had no potential to be anything but an adversary in the emerging great power competition that characterizes the world today. Nor will Russia simply go away because Biden is in power in Washington. Russia is not intimidated, nor will Putin cease to be exactly who he has always been. NATO and the Baltics must realize that real problems still exist and have not been solved by a single election thousands of miles away.\nBiden has begun his term taking a conciliatory approach to NATO, claiming that he is going to repair the alliance. This fits squarely on the premise that Trump has broken the alliance. But as we have seen, this premise falls when the many improvements to the security situation in Europe are seen. The problems with Western allies, such as Germany and France, largely came from differences of opinion on the nature of the Russian threat and those countries’ resistance to increasing their contributions according to the United States’ agenda. These problems were purely political, and were not created by Trump. While blaming Trump for the tension within the alliance may be convenient, it does not provide a complete picture of what happened, nor does the tension present mean that the alliance was broken. Indeed, NATO has withstood far greater tests and far more divisive leaders, such as Charles de Gaulle, in the past. None of this was anything unprecedented or new, nor was it an obstacle to presenting a NATO more capable to face off an aggressive adversary.\nThis conciliatory approach may make many in Europe’s capitals happier, but it does nothing to solve the non-political, hard security problems that NATO faces. Indeed, the Biden administration may well be ushering in a new era of complacency in NATO, as it seeks to placate Germany and others. Certainly it will continue to push for increased contributions from the allies – even the Obama administration did that – but, will it be able to achieve any meaningful results if it completely eschews the carrot and stick tactics of its predecessor? What motivation does Germany have to make any improvements if it has nothing to lose for its complacency? Besides, Berlin continues to favor improved relations with Russia and continues to pursue Nord Stream 2. And how far does that conciliatory approach go? Some U.S. political figures and even the New York Times at one point found fault with the Trump administration for causing problems with Germany by way of the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, rather than finding fault with Germany for pursuing the project. If all the Biden administration can do is say that the project is a “bad deal” for Europe, then there is nothing to stop its completion. After all, the Navalny poisoning has not deterred Berlin. If playing nice and being conciliatory is repairing our alliances, how far does that go when an ally is clearly out of line?\nThis leads to another problem. The Biden administration has made many such statements about repairing the alliance, supporting NATO, and countering the Russian threat, but there has been little elaboration as to how this will be done. Rather than building plans for how to face the challenges upcoming on the world stage, the Biden administration has been busy attempting to reverse as many Trump policies as it possibly can along partisan lines. This leaves allies with nothing to base their enthusiasm on but empty rhetoric. How will Biden support NATO? How will the United States stand up to Russia? Indeed, the extension of the New-START Treaty was something Russia wanted very badly. Likewise, the Kremlin would love to see the United States return to the Iran nuclear deal, and let us not forget that Moscow and Tehran are allies. Giving Russia what it wants, and doing so without gaining any concessions from the Kremlin in return, will do nothing to signal strength or resolve in combatting its malign activities. While many Europeans also wanted to see these policies advanced, it should give pause to recognize that Russia wanted them too. Why might that be? If the United States, NATO, and the EU wish to counter Russia (and the EU’s position is already rather weak given German and French influence there), they must consider that there is very little room for common ground or mutual interest with the Kremlin. There are usually ulterior motives in Moscow.\nBiden has also put great emphasis on diplomacy in his speeches. But what good is diplomacy when you give the adversary what it wants without thinking through why it might want it? And what good is it when there is nothing to enforce changes of behavior? The Biden administration can talk to Berlin all it wants about Nord Stream 2 being a bad deal for Europe, but if there is no threat of consequences, nor reward for halting construction, then what good can come from that? If it unhesitatingly initiates a return to policies that Moscow likes, and only makes vague statements about standing up to Russia’s aggression with no force to back that up, what good comes from that? And if he makes good on the promise to return U.S. troops to Germany, what good is that if they are not able to be rapidly deployed to the East? This is not the Cold War; Russia will not be attacking from East Germany. What good is it to have troops present, when they are still far away from any likely theater of attack? A more forward presence would be a stronger deterrent. Sure, nobody likes these questions, but they must be asked if foreign policy is to resemble anything like a strategy instead of a series of reversals on partisan grounds. Besides, if there is to be nothing more than a reversal of each predecessor’s policies any time someone from the opposite party gets elected in the United States, this will do grievous harm to America’s allies’ ability to trust it to uphold any commitments it makes or to lead with any effectiveness.\nFinally, Joe Biden does not have a good track record of foreign policy success. He was a proponent of the Iraq War, largely the outcome of groupthink, and now widely criticized on the left and right alike. He then spearheaded the Obama administration’s withdrawal from Iraq, which created the power vacuum that ISIS filled in northern Iraq and Syria. Further, as the architect of much of Obama’s foreign policy, Biden was one of the chief advocates for the much ballyhooed policy of targeted drone strikes in lieu of broader counterterrorism strategy, which brought about great civilian casualties and damaged the United States’ reputation abroad. Likewise, the Obama administration, with Joe Biden as its primary foreign policy figure, bungled regime change in Libya, resulting in a civil war there, failed to respond strategically to the events of the Arab Spring, and dropped the ball on the infamous “red line” in Syria. All these led to the massive refugee crisis that has plagued Europe. But it does not end there. The Obama administration claimed to support Ukraine, but provided no lethal aid to Kyiv in its fight against Russia, and allegedly then vice-president Biden threatened to cut off $1 billion dollars in funding if the government did not fire the prosecutor investigating a natural gas company where his son sat on the board. Across the board, the Obama administration’s policies, with great influence from Joe Biden, did little to nothing to improve the situation for Eastern Europe. As Brookings, far from a right wing institution, points out, Obama was extremely timid with respect to deterring Russia, and opposed taking a more hardline approach to the Kremlin. The personal animosity between Obama and Putin did not translate into a tougher policy.\nNor did any mutual admiration with Putin result in weaker policy in the Trump administration. As Brookings puts it, “the [Trump] administration approved the provision of lethal weapons to Ukraine, shut down Russia’s consulate in San Francisco as well as two additional diplomatic annexes, and rather than rolling back sanctions, Trump signed into law additional sanctions on Russia, expanded LNG sales to a Europe dependent in Russian gas imports, and increased the Pentagon’s European Reassurance Initiative budget by 40 percent… credit should be given where credit is due.” These administrations’ policies are in stark contrast to one another, despite the rhetoric of each. For his timidity, Obama did nothing to deter Russia – even the sanctions package was minimal in its effects on Russian policy. Likewise, despite his provocative personality, Donald Trump made Eastern Europe a more difficult target for Russian aggression with an experienced team of professionals managing Russia policy.\nSince Joe Biden was the leader on foreign policy in the Obama administration, Eastern Europe should have cause for concern. While Biden does seem now to recognize the Russian threat (while continuing to downplay the threat of China), there are no statements of policy that indicate any difference in his administration’s approach to Russia than what he and Obama did before. Sure he may be more friendly with Europe, and may even put more troops in Germany, but if he is squeamish about using military force to deter Russia, then NATO’s Eastern Flank can expect neglect. What good is a friend if he tells you over and over that he supports you and will be there for you, but does not come to help when needed? Did his promises mean anything?\nJoe Biden’s new administration is heralded by most as the return to an era of normal. He claims he will repair our alliances and combat Russia with a heavy emphasis on diplomacy. He rails against the alleged failures of the previous administration, many of which can be seen as categorically untrue, and claims that America is back. But what reason do we have to believe that this is so? I sincerely hope that I am wrong in this presentation, but amid the raucous applause and unquestioning approval of my peers and even those who are far superior in their expertise than me, I am deeply, gravely concerned that all this is but “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” If so, it is the Baltics and Eastern Europe that will suffer for it. Nonetheless, I present this contrarian view, in the hope that someone will stop and think, question, and speak. Let us not be caught off guard, disarmed by ourselves.\nCover Photo: Joe Biden with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Creative Commons.

During the past 30 years the instruments of Russian foreign policy have transformed to better serve its regional interests. Although armed conflicts like those evolving as a result of Russian aggression in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 can still be found almost in every post-Soviet republic, Russian policy has in general become more complex and now includes specific elements like economic control and soft power influence. One of such instruments is Moscow’s energy diplomacy.\nThe Russian Federation is one of the world leaders in hydrocarbon reserves: 60 billion barrels of oil (in some years ahead of the Saudi Arabia in production, though Russia is still unable to export as much as Aramco) and first place in natural gas reserves make Russia one of the top actors on world energy market. Moscow exports hydrocarbons mainly to former Soviet republics, EU countries and Turkey.\nFor the Russian Federation, the oil and gas sector is important in two ways: first, in terms of economic value, it is one of the main articles of revenues to the federal budget; second, in terms of Russian political ambitions, energy diplomacy has gradually become one of the country’s main instruments to maintain control over neighboring states.\nToday both Ukraine and the Baltics remain dependent on Russian natural gas either as the primary consumers or, in the Ukrainian case, as an importer of natural gas via virtual reverse-flow from Poland or Slovakia, though the gas is still, physically, Russian. As it is important for Moscow to keep post-Soviet and European countries directly dependent on energy exports, Russia started to implement “gas aggression” tactics at the beginning of the 21st century, the most vivid example of which is seen in Ukraine-Russia relations. For instance, in 2006 Russia cut off gas supplies and reduced its transit through Ukrainian territory to the EU. In 2009 Moscow had a more global goal, in particular to intensify the political conflict in Ukraine by completely cutting off gas supplies (for both domestic consumption and transit to the EU), which should have formed the idea of Ukraine as an unreliable gas transit country to Europe. Since gaining independence, the blackmail from Moscow to cut off gas flow has become a beloved method of our eastern neighbor, which is often used to extrapolate its political will on Kyiv.\nMoreover, since independence, Ukraine has not only experienced several “gas wars” with Russia but has also been in a situation when it had to constantly ask for a reduction in gas prices. This is illustrated, in particular, by the Kharkiv Agreements signed by Viktor Yanukovych in 2010, when the price of gas was reduced by 30 percent in exchange for the extension of the Black Sea Fleet’s stay in Sevastopol for another 25 years from 2017.\nThe Baltics’ situation is very similar to that of Ukraine. Despite joining European Union and NATO in 2004, as well as engaging in European energy strategies, getting rid of dependence on Russian gas imports remains a primary goal for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Due to the fact that the Baltics inherited energy infrastructure from the USSR, after the restoration of independence the countries found themself in a situation where they were forced to continue buying Russian hydrocarbons, and, what is more, for one of the highest prices among the European states. Furthermore, an important factor was the high share of domestic gas companies owned by the Russian company Gazprom (at some point the share reached 37 percent in Eesti Gaas, 34 percent in Latvias Gāze and 37 percent in Lietuvos Dujo, although after 2014 these figures decreased significantly), which allowed Russia to influence the energy policy and strategy of the Baltic states.\nhe Baltic States, as well as Ukraine, have experienced several “gas wars” with Russia. The direct cut off of gas supply, however, has not taken place but once, when in 1993 Estonia refused to grant direct citizenship to all the people living in the country after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, gas related blackmail is still common in Russo-Baltic relations, especially in the context of Moscow willing to “protect” the Russian-speaking minority rights in the Baltic republics.\nAnother example of Moscow’s energy diplomacy is Ukraine’s dependence on the transit of Russian gas to Europe. On the one hand, the revenues from gas transit are important for the Ukrainian state budget. However, as Moscow seeks to maintain its position as one of the leading suppliers of natural gas to Europe, it also realizes the interdependence of the two parties in this question. Though Russia is purposely limiting gas transit from countries like Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan to reduce the number of gas importers to the European market, it still has to negotiate with Kyiv as the capacity of Ukrainian pipelines remains the largest to provide natural gas transmission from East to West. Russia tries to develop new projects to reduce the role of Ukraine as the gas supply route in the future. As a result, the construction of Nord Stream 1 and 2, as well as TurkStream began.\nIn this context, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have repeatedly expressed unity in issues regarding the threats posed by the construction of Nord Stream 2 for Europe’s energy security, thus emphasizing the importance of countering Russia’s attempts to make European countries dependent on Russian hydrocarbons import.\nFrom this point of view, it is absolutely clear that Russian energy diplomacy has become not only about economic benefits, but about expanding its political influence in neighboring countries. The tactic is rather transparent: the reduction of gas prices may come in exchange for concessions on military or political issues that are of great importance to Moscow; otherwise there is constant pressure that the countries have to live under.\nConsidering all the challenges mentioned above, along with the facts of Russian hybrid aggression, we believe that cooperation between Ukraine on one side and Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia on the other can lay a strong foundation for a new energy security system in the Baltic-Black Sea region. If the diplomatic and economic ties between Ukraine and the Baltics continue to evolve, our countries have all the prospects for strengthening their energy security and gaining independence from Russian influence. Likewise, acting as a single front, our countries have all the chances to raise their geopolitical status and finally come out of the geopolitical periphery, which bears even more opportunities for future economic growth.\nSpeaking about a specific plan for cooperation, it is worth mentioning that the Baltic republics have already implemented several projects in the energy security area, the largest of them being the LNG terminal in the Lithuanian port of Klaipėda, which began operating in December 2014. At the opening ceremony, former Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė stated, “From now on, nobody will be able to dictate the price of gas to us or buy our political will, or bribe our politicians.” The Klaipėda terminal allowed Lithuania to import more hydrocarbons from Norway than from Russia for the first time in 2016. In addition, in the long run it has the potential to secure gas supplies to all the Baltic republics, as well as to neighboring countries such as Belarus, Poland and Ukraine.\nIn recent years, a number of other projects increased significantly, aiming to fully integrate the Baltic states into the European energy system. For example, in 2020, the Balticconnector pipeline was launched, connecting the Estonian city of Paldiski with the Finnish city of Ingå. Also, GIPL (Gas Interconnection Poland-Lithuania) is projected to be ready for operation by the end of 2021.\nThis experience can be useful for Ukraine not only in considering the project of an LNG terminal in the port of Odesa or connecting to the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) to export hydrocarbons from the Southern Caucasus countries, mainly Azerbaijan. What is more important, Ukraine and the Baltic states can promote North-South cooperation in the Baltic-Black Sea region to strengthen energy security, which is one of the main goals on Europe’s agenda nowadays.\nWe can see that some concrete mechanisms of cooperation between our countries have already been established over the past several years. For instance, we can mention the initiative of the Lublin Triangle (Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania), the purpose of which is to support Ukraine’s EU integration but also to strengthen the regional military and economic system, including decreasing dependence on Russia in all areas.\nNonetheless, the concrete steps to develop our ties in the energy sector are far more necessary than the politicians’ words. The most remarkable project that is widely spoken about is connecting the LNG terminal at Klaipėda in Lithuania with Western Ukraine’s gas transmission system. At the beginning of 2020, Minsk reached an agreement with Vilnius to start oil exports via Baltic ports to reduce dependency on Moscow. As the Minsk-Vilnius Gas Transmission Pipeline has already been built to connect Klaipėda LNG Terminal and Lithuania distribution systems with the territory of Belarus, extending it to Ukraine might be only a matter of time, money, and political will.\nAt the same time, considering such an opportunity, we cannot fail to mention the obvious difficulties. First, the Lithuania-Belarus-Ukraine common project has never been proposed before, thus the pre-construction phase (political consultations and project development) as well as the construction itself would be a matter of several years or more. Second, remembering the latest events in Belarus and the fact that neither Lithuania nor Ukraine recognized the stated results of the 2020 elections together with the renewed sanctions from Western countries, cooperation with Minsk could be a problem for both Vilnius and Kyiv that might not be solved in the nearest future due to the political complexity of the situation.\nWith all that said, we cannot deny that the “Ukraine-Baltic” geopolitical axis can balance Moscow’s growing influence in Europe, especially considering the renewing Russo-German and Russo-French cooperation over the past couple of years. As a result of increased Ukraine-Baltic cooperation, not only will the regional stability be secured, but this will also promote the East-West constructive dialogue in the framework of Ukrainian integration to the EU. Moreover, this would strengthen the role of Ukraine as a reliable gas transit country not only in the East-West direction but, in the framework of the Baltic-Black Sea countries cooperation and the new hydrocarbons transmission systems being built, as a strong partner to provide gas transportation along the North-South axis.\nSo, to summarize the points stated above, we can mention two main areas as the prospects for Ukraine-Baltic energy cooperation:\nconnecting the gas supply infrastructure between the Baltic States and Central and Eastern Europe within the framework of the North-South Energy Corridor project along the North-South axis; the proposed project is to build Ukraine-Belarus interconnection to enable hydrocarbons imports mainly from Norway through the port of Klaipėda in Lithuania, which would also strengthen the role of Ukraine as a transit country for gas transmission along East-West and North-South axis;\nand ensuring the possibility of obtaining new partners to balance Russian influence and diversify hydrocarbons import sources; this cooperation might be established with the North Sea countries from the Baltics’ side, and relations with the Central Asian states can be strengthened to import hydrocarbons through Ukraine (primarily from Kazakhstan).\nCover photo: Image by K.

This agreement contains a number of provisions that will facilitate greater defense cooperation between the United States and Poland and improve deterrence and battle readiness for NATO along the alliance’s Eastern Flank. For the Baltics, this ratification is welcome news, as it not only improves the regional deterrent posture, but also a number of crucial conditions in Poland to enable more rapid and effective defense in the event of Russian aggression on their territory.\nWhat it Contains The EDCA is a product of continuing amicable U.S.-Polish bilateral relations and defense cooperation, and contains a number of crucial provisions that will aid NATO’s mutual defense mission on the Eastern Flank, and particularly, in the Baltic theater. These are as follows:\n•\tFirst, it augments the 1951 NATO Status of Forces Agreement, outlining the legal status of U.S. forces and related personnel in Poland and providing clearance for them to access specific Polish military installations and conduct activities related to mutual defense.\n•\tSecond, it supports the expansion of necessary infrastructure for host nation support and logistics, enabling an increased U.S. military presence in Poland. The costs of these improvements will be shared by both countries, with the U.S. continuing to take on the costs of training, equipping, and deploying its troops.\n•\tThird, it establishes an increase in the number of U.S. troops present on rotation in Poland from 4,500 to at least 5,500. This includes the forward elements of the U.S. Army V Corps headquarters and a division headquarters; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and along with the necessary infrastructure, will allow for the presence of an armored brigade combat team and a combat aviation brigade.\n•\tLastly, the provisions for expanded infrastructure will ensure the possibility of immediate deployment of 20,000 additional U.S. troops to Poland in the event of a possible existential threat or crisis.\nPresently, the U.S. leads the NATO enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) battlegroup at Orzysz, in northeastern Poland, and deploys an armored brigade combat team there. These new provisions will facilitate the expansion of this cooperation in an essential strategic zone.\nWhy it Matters Orzysz is located in the Masurian Lakes region in Poland, about 125 kilometers from the Polish-Lithuanian border by road. The proximity of U.S. forces and the eFP battlegroup in Orzysz to the Suwałki Gap is important for their rapid deployment into the Baltic theater if necessary, and for the defense of the Gap itself should Russia seek to control that zone, cutting off the Baltics from the rest of Europe. The increased troop presence here will strengthen the deterrent provided by the eFP battlegroup and will facilitate preparedness for rapid defensive action. Further, improvements to the infrastructure will provide for greater efficiency in deployment of troops, equipment, and supplies. Likewise, these improvements will build Poland’s capacity to host even greater numbers of troops, leaving Warsaw better prepared for a crisis. This, in turn, adds to the deterrent posture, as an aggressor will not only have to worry about the eFP battalions, but the rapid deployment of tens of thousands more troops.\nAt face value, clearances and other such personnel related permissions may seem dull and unimportant, but these legal frameworks are critical for efficiency in decision-making. By creating these frameworks, the U.S. and Poland have established the means for answering important questions with access and protocol for both training and conflict situations. In the event of a crisis, these frameworks will ensure that the defenders are able to respond quickly, coherently, and effectively.\nThe infrastructure component provides another interesting angle vis-à-vis the regional theater: the landscape in that northeastern portion of Poland and across into Lithuania is swampy and thickly forested, and lacks adequate infrastructure to accommodate heavy armored vehicle transport. While that region itself is not a good candidate for armored combat, central Lithuania is, and tank warfare capabilities are a crucial strength for Russia. Thus, it is necessary for the United States to establish an effective means of transporting such equipment into Lithuania. These agreed upon improvements to infrastructure could improve armored mobility to combat the Russian tank threat in Lithuania.\nConclusion All in all, the EDCA fits well within U.S. security strategy in Eastern Europe, reinforcing continued defense cooperation with Poland and improving the effectiveness of said cooperation. The agreement provides a foundation for growing readiness for conflict by establishing important protocols, building infrastructure and capacity, and increasing troop presence along the Eastern flank and near the strategic Suwałki Gap. This not only provides increased preparedness for war, but establishes a more credible deterrent along a “peace through strength” rationale. By signing and ratifying the EDCA, the U.S. and Poland have made a significant contribution to security along NATO’s Eastern Flank and particularly within the Baltic theater. The Baltics and Poland alike can only hope for continuity in defense cooperation with the United States over the next decade in order to preserve their territorial integrity and independence. Now is not the time for the U.S. to abandon Eastern Europe.\nCover photo: The U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and the Polish Defense Minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, signed the EDCA at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw on August 15, 2020.

After this commitment, and following Russian aggression in Ukraine, NATO turned the corner on its declining defense expenditures. Facing a new challenge in a revisionist Russia, many allies to the east felt a new sense of urgency about funding their defense, aiming to build a credible deterrent against aggression on their own territory. Since 2015, NATO defense spending has increased each year on the whole, and this year, two more allies are projected to meet the two percent benchmark. But while this number has been oft discussed and been the subject of much rhetoric, what ultimately matters is not only how much the allies are spending, but how they are spending it. Are member states making wise decisions with their money?\nOne of the common arguments against using the two percent benchmark for NATO expenditures in defense is that NATO counts all personnel related expenditures, including pensions. Under that accounting system, Greece has consistently met the mark; however, in 2018, Greece spent 75 percent of its defense budget on personnel and pension costs. This argument, and the example of Greece, is usually used to insist that more complacent allies are doing enough with whatever percent they are spending and do not need to get their act together. This is a misuse of the data in question.\nUltimately, members not meeting the threshold they agreed to in 2014 are negligent in failing to do so, as the threat environment in Europe has changed since that time. Likewise, the argument itself is misleading, as it points to an extreme case in Greece among the countries meeting the two percent. Of the seven countries who spent an excess of 60 percent of their defense budgets on personnel this year, only Greece and Croatia are spending above the median 1.86 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, most countries spend the largest percentage of their budgets on personnel – even the United States. Indeed, personnel is a critical component to defense – you cannot expect to win a war with nobody to do the fighting. What truly matters here is both what the allies spend and how they choose to spend it.\nEven if a country is investing in the right areas for its defense, if it is not investing enough in those areas, it will be unprepared to fight. Consider the following analogy: Fred and Maureen need to spend 30 percent of their weekly income on groceries in order to have enough food for the week. If they only spend 15 percent of their weekly income on groceries, they will go hungry by Wednesday even if they spent that 15 percent on a balanced diet. So member states can pat themselves on the back all they want for purchasing some necessary weapons system, for example, but in time of crisis, if they do not have enough of these armaments, the purchase is meaningless. They will still be deficient in that capability, and they will lose on the battlefield.\nIn 2020, ten NATO members are projected to reach the two percent benchmark. These are: The United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, and newcomers France and Norway. Of these, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania have national laws and agreements to meet two percent of GDP on defense expenditures annually. Both politically and geographically, this comes as no surprise – these are some of the most vocal members about the seriousness of the Russian threat. But how are these allies spending their defense budgets? The following graph from the October 21, 2020 NATO communique on defense spending breaks down how each of the allies is spending its money:\nSource: Source: NATO.org, “Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2013-2020).” Communique. 21 October 2020. Pg. 5.\nAmong the Baltic States, Lithuania spends the most on personnel (44.5 percent), followed by Latvia (37.0 percent), and Estonia (34.3 percent). It is reasonable that Latvia is in the middle here: it does not rely on conscription, so it has a smaller personnel component; but, in order to maintain a fully professional military, it must spend enough on its soldiers, sailors, and airmen to make the military a viable career. In operations, maintenance, and other related expenditures, the results are reversed; Estonia leads this time (40.5 percent), Latvia remains in the middle (29.1 percent), and Lithuania follows (24.4 percent). This too is no surprise: Estonia has hosted numerous military exercises this year, and the Estonian conscripts continued to train (safely) in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the allies (all except Luxembourg) are spending less than 10 percent of their defense budgets on infrastructure. Here, the Baltic States are among those spending above the average. Latvia and Estonia are both spending 7.9 percent of their defense budgets on infrastructure, while Lithuania is spending closer to (but still well above) the median value at 4.9 percent. This can largely be explained by improvements to the aging and largely inadequate transport infrastructure in the Baltic States, as well as investments in critical energy and communications infrastructure and in Host Nation Support capabilities. On equipment procurements and research and development (R\u0026amp;D), Lithuania and Latvia are spending nearly identical percentages (26.2 and 26.0 respectively), and Estonia is spending 17.3 percent in that area. For Lithuania and Latvia, this represents a considerable increase over the past six years, and a modest, but still considerable drop for Estonia during that time. Yet context is necessary here: for many years, Estonia has been consistent in its procurements, while Lithuania and Latvia have been playing catch up since 2014.\nIn the Baltic context, these percentages provide insight into each state’s priorities. Estonia has less need to invest in weapons systems and other equipment procurements: it has been consistent in that area already and is ahead of its peers, though improvements in that category remain important. Instead, it has greater need of infrastructural improvements (indeed, fixing bridges was part of Estonia’s training routine this year), particularly with regard to transportation logistics. Meanwhile, Estonia’s focus on preparedness clearly explains why it leads (by far) on operational expenditures.\nLatvia, on the other hand, has had to play catch up on procurements, and has done so rapidly. That said, the focus has primarily been on land based deterrence, so there remain critical weaknesses in the air and maritime domains. The same rings true in Estonia and Lithuania. For Latvia, training is important, but since it maintains a fully professional military, it does not need to spend as much as Estonia (or really, Lithuania) on organizing and implementing training events. To a large degree, it is Latvia’s policy of maintaining a fully professional military, rather than relying on conscription, that puts it firmly in the middle of its neighbors in both operations and personnel. Lastly, on infrastructure, Latvia faces similar problems to Estonia: the road and rail networks are inadequate for the logistical needs of war, Host Nation Support capabilities need continued improvement, and critical energy and communications infrastructure need greater security.\nLithuania, like Latvia, has made quick work of procuring necessary equipment and weapons systems over the past six years to fill in critical gaps in its defensive posture. Lithuania spends the most on personnel, which is reasonable considering it has the largest population among the Baltics (by a considerable margin) and relies on conscription. Estonia, which also relies on conscription, has the smallest population. It is interesting that Lithuania spends the least among its Baltic peers on operations and infrastructure. On infrastructure, it is reasonable to say that Lithuania was ahead of its peers in making improvements, but much more work remains in developing its highway and rail systems, as well as securing critical energy and communications infrastructure and improving Host Nation Support. It is not surprising that Lithuania spends less here, but perhaps that it spends as little as it does. Regarding operations, expenditures are fairly comparable with Latvia’s, and the difference between it and its neighbors this year may be reflected in part by its COVID-19 policies in addition to more typical factors, such as logistical expenditures for say, fuel.\nFor each country, a national security strategy, or at minimum some coherence on defense policy, is crucial for budgeting defense expenditures. After 2014, the two percent threshold is critical – not only does this reflect a deteriorating security situation in the east vis-à-vis Russia (and now Belarus), but if members do not abide by it, their negligence will amount to clear unreliability. They clearly seen as all talk and no action. How they spend that two percent, however, is even more important. Procurements should be economized to maximize their added value and make room for other needed equipment and armaments. Spending on infrastructure should reflect the needs of each country, both in the Baltic context and in NATO as a whole. Each should be done responsibly, minimizing waste, fraud, and abuse. This can only be achieved when policy is coherent and strategic. Likewise, training and operations budgeting should reflect the needs of each country and should be done based on critical weaknesses and priorities identified in the context of realistic scenarios. Finally, spending on personnel should be adequate for maintaining a capable and motivated military force, without being done irresponsibly. In the Baltic context, a regional security strategy may be helpful to help Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania make joint procurements to maximize added value and achieve outsized results compared with their limited resources. Likewise, it will help identify common areas for training needs and infrastructural improvements, particularly with regard to military logistics, a crucial regional weakness.\nWhen push comes to shove, military preparedness should not be a politically divisive issue. All countries should seek to be as well prepared to defend the homeland as they can possibly be, even in the context of collective security within NATO. Within that, they should be prudent with their money, investing enough to meet or exceed their needs, maximizing the added value of their investments, and demonstrating to its foes that NATO is credible. For small countries, like the Baltic States, NATO’s credibility is key: without the resources on their own to defeat or even adequately deter Russia, they need NATO to stand tall. And it is for this reason that what other allies spend on defense, and how they spend it, matters for the Baltics.\nCover Photo: Flags of member states outside NATO Headquarters in Brussels.

Since President Aleksandr Lukashenko was declared the winner of the fraudulent presidential elections on August 9, the country has spiraled into civil unrest and authoritarian repression, and the headlines keep coming like a stampede. While no one was surprised by the announced outcome of the election, most analysts would not have predicted that Belarus would be launched headlong into a persistent crisis. Nonetheless, it has, and Western leaders need to be prepared for a number of scenarios unfolding along NATO’s eastern flank.\nAs Belarus descends into greater uncertainty and instability, a number of concurrent events are taking place for NATO in the Baltics. As part of a pre-planned, defensive exercise, U.S. troops arrived in Lithuania at the beginning of September. The exercises, which feature 500 American servicemen and 40 vehicles, including Abrams tanks and Bradley armored troop carriers, will last until November. Yet another NATO exercise was planned for mid-September, featuring a battalion of 300-1,000 American troops, as well as 1,000 troops and warplanes from several of the European allies, such as France, Poland, Italy, and Germany. Meanwhile, on September 7, it was reported that Germany would allocate 500,000 Euros for the design of ammunition storage facilities in Lithuania. Interestingly, Sweden, a non-member partner state of NATO, increased its military preparedness level at the end of August to a level not seen since 1991. Stockholm has deployed fighter jets and tanks to the island of Gotland, a strategic jumping-off point in the Baltic Sea, and four Swedish corvettes are conducting exercises with a Finnish minesweeper. Yet the Swedish military and foreign ministers’ messages contradict each other on the relation of these events to events in Belarus, with the foreign minister tying Swedish activity to Russian naval exercises in the Baltic while the military’s statement pointed to regional instability.\nOn the other side, we have a beleaguered Lukashenko seeking the Kremlin’s aid, knowing full well that he is making a Faustian bargain, but like a contestant on “Press Your Luck,” believing that he can still hold on to sovereignty after one more spin. He has kept his grip on his sovereignty before, and if he can just hold on to power, surely he can do it again. But Russia has little patience left for Lukashenko, and this high stakes gamble has no guarantees for the Belarusian strongman. Indeed, Russia has positioned itself to be an arbiter of regime change in Minsk. After all, Lukashenko’s role as the sole interlocutor and his tight control on the political system in Belarus were extraordinarily inconvenient for Moscow. Meanwhile, Russia has sent a battalion of 300 paratroopers armed with heavy equipment to Brest, along the Polish border, to participate in the Slavic Brotherhood exercises. Not to be missed in this is the fact that the battalion in question is a paratrooper battalion – these soldiers have a reputation in Russian society for gross misconduct. As one Russian in St. Petersburg put it, they are “wholly inadequate” members of society. It is highly significant that Russia is sending some of its most brutal soldiers to Belarus. Meanwhile, it has been announced that the Slavic Brotherhood exercises have been extended in duration, and will be followed up by further exercises in Belarus. This mimicry of the rotational NATO exercises will provide a continual foothold for Russia in Belarus.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Baltics and Belarus have been engaging in a diplomatic tit-for-tat. The Baltics have all recognized Svyatlana Tsikhanovskaya as the rightful president of Belarus and have barred Lukashenko and his allies from entering their countries. In response, Lukashenko has banned Baltic politicians from Belarus. Further, Minsk has closed the borders with Poland and Lithuania, and has increased security on its southern border with Ukraine; however, this has had little practical implementation and appears to be little more than a propaganda campaign which emphasizes an external threat of Western aggression. Meanwhile, NATO emphasizes the defensive nature of exercises in Lithuania, reiterating that the West has no designs on attacking Belarus.\nWhatever the future holds for Belarus, it is clear that Russia aims to strengthen its grip on Minsk. The West should be prepared for any scenario involving a continual presence of Russian troops on Belarusian soil, whether through rotational exercises, implementation of the Union State Treaty, the institution of a new puppet regime, or the annexation of Belarus. In any case, the strategic depth that a neutral Belarus under a sovereign Lukashenko could provide has been lost. Likewise, any hope of establishing a pro-Western government with a respect for human rights and the rule of law is a pipe dream so long as Russia maintains its current posture. After all, Nicolas Maduro still de facto holds power in Venezuela, despite widespread recognition of Juan Guaido as the rightful leader. With Russian interests in Belarus so strong, there is next to zero chance that Tsikhanovskaya could become a de facto president in Minsk.\nLosing Belarus as strategic depth, and having no realistic chance of turning Belarus into an ally, the narrow Suwałki Gap, which constitutes the only land border between the Baltic States and the rest of NATO, becomes an even trickier problem for the alliance. As such, NATO must be prepared for rapid deployment northward into the Baltic States, and should be focused on maintaining supply and transport routes through the gap and at sea. In order to ensure rapid deployment into the Baltic theater, it is critical that NATO establish a more forward presence in the east, including permanent basing in Poland or the Baltics themselves. Likewise, NATO should consider naval power projection in the Baltic Sea to reverse Russia’s local advantage in the maritime domain, and it should also seek to address the challenges posed by Russia’s anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) components in Kaliningrad by finding weaknesses within the Russian posture there. With Russia ever closer to surrounding the Baltics, NATO needs serious leadership to soberly address the strategic gaps for the alliance in the region and ensure that a viable plan for defense, not merely rescue, is in place for the Baltic States.\nCover Photo: Protesters in Minsk wave the traditional \u0026ldquo;white-red-white\u0026rdquo; Belarusian flag.

The treaty established Latvia’s sovereignty and Soviet Russia recognized Latvia’s independence as “inviolable” for all time. But the Soviet Union did not honor this treaty, nor its treaties with Estonia and Lithuania. Between these treaties and other, more modern treaties such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, we can see that Russia only abides by the treaties it signs for as long as it is convenient, then breaks them when it seems it can get away with doing so.\nWhile the Soviet treaty with Latvia states that the latter’s independence was forever “inviolable,” Russia agreed to “renounce voluntarily forever” its rights to sovereignty in Estonia based on any historical treaty and “unreservedly” recognize Estonia’s right to sovereignty in its own lands. Meanwhile, in the Soviet-Lithuanian treaty, Russia refused to recognize Lithuania as the successor to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but would recognize Lithuanian independence and most territorial claims on the principle of self-determination.\nSoviet Russia abandoned all of these principles in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939. Self-determination made way for “spheres of influence,” and ultimately, for the Baltics, annexation. The forever inviolable independence and sovereignty of Latvia and Estonia was only inviolable for about 20 years. Once the Soviet economy had recovered from its devastating civil war, it wanted to take the Baltics back, reneging on its promises to eschew claims to former imperial territory. From 1940-1991, the Baltics suffered under occupation by the Soviet Union (and briefly Nazi Germany in 1941), annexed illegally and against their will.\nIn more recent history, the United States abrogated the INF Treaty with Russia on the grounds that Russia was not in compliance. Despite the issue being raised more than thirty times prior to abrogation, Russia never showed any intent to get back in line. Rather, it chose to obfuscate its missile tests, accuse the United States of cheating and starting an arms race, and continue pursuing new offensive capabilities prohibited by the treaty. Pundits and politicians alike rushed to condemn the United States’ decision, amplifying Russian propaganda messaging in the process. But, so long as one side is not abiding by the agreed upon terms, and is not making any attempt to get back into compliance, such a treaty provides no security guarantees. At best, it may bring a false comfort, but it would be delusional to suggest it promotes peace.\nThe hard reality of it is this: Russia and other bad faith actors, such as Iran and China, do not abide by the treaties they sign forever. If they do comply, it is only for so long as it suits them. Then, they will exploit loopholes or brazenly violate their agreements. Further, Russia uses lawfare to create quasi-legal justifications for its actions, redefining the terms of an agreement so as to perpetuate some myth of compliance and Western hypocrisy/aggression. This is not to say that treaties are not worthwhile. They can bring some measure of reassurance, especially if they contain enforcement measures with teeth. They can provide diplomatic leverage, and communicate peaceful intentions. But, in and of themselves, where there is no motivation for an aggressive party to comply, treaties are not a cure-all.\nMan has been making treaties since ancient times. A useful illustration of the need for sufficient consequences for treaty violations is found in Genesis chapter 31. In that account, Jacob and Laban made a covenant not to attack one another. Given Laban’s treatment of Jacob earlier in the story, as well as other accounts of his activities, Laban is clearly a scoundrel whose modus operandi is to act in bad faith towards anyone he meets. There is no reason Jacob should have trusted Laban. But, in the ancient world, people made such covenants with God (or gods) as their witness, and they feared the destruction that would befall them should they break their treaty. The only teeth this non-aggression pact had was the witness of God, and Laban was sufficiently afraid of the consequences should he violate his oath. Thus, the treaty was effective. But in modern international relations, a bad faith actor does not necessarily have this fear. Unless Russia (or China, or Iran) expects unacceptable consequences for violating its part of an agreement, there is nothing to stop it from following its habit of breaking treaties. Where there are no repercussions, or where the repercussions are deemed tolerable, man does what he wants. The same is true of governments. A treaty which one side violates while the other side complies can only benefit the violator, if anyone at all. It is at best a placebo, providing some measure of psychological comfort, but no real treatment.\nIn the context of Baltic security, and security in Eastern Europe writ-large, it would be a mistake to put too much stock in the efficacy of a treaty with Russia. Time and again, Russia has proven itself not to be trustworthy; it seldom keeps promises, and it frequently breaks them. All three Baltic States’ peace treaties with Soviet Russia were broken, and all three suffered under the communist yoke for fifty years of illegal occupation. With no one to stop them, the Soviets brutally took what they had only years before acknowledged was not theirs. And 21st century history tells us that when the opportunity arises, and the consequences are sufficiently tolerable, Russia will seize what it wants. From Crimea to Georgia, Russia has violated the sovereignty of its neighbors with little hesitation and with insufficient consequences.\nA well-crafted treaty with sufficient enforcement mechanisms may be useful for a time, but will be hard to achieve and will eventually go the way of INF, ceasing to be effective and needing abrogation or replacement. For NATO, the best bet in Eastern Europe is to pursue diplomatic avenues where possible, but be prepared for the eventual expiration of their efficacy. How can NATO be prepared? By putting forth a strong deterrence posture and a formidable defense. In other words, make the consequences for violation unacceptably costly for Russia.\nCover Photo: Josef Stalin and German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop at the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

For what was supposed to be another easy campaign in Lukashenko’s winning streak, the protests leading up, and following the elections have sparked internal turmoil in Belarus.\nThe Belarusian government now faces its biggest crisis in 26 years, as protests and police violence sweep the capital and the opposition increases their demands. Svetlana made headlights again after contesting the election results and then leaving the country under threat from the KGB.\nThe internal unrest in Belarus also worries international observers, as the country has recently feuded with Russia - its biggest ally and possibly biggest threat - arresting 32 Russian mercenaries and placing troops at Russia’s border.\nLukashenko infamously quipped that “the country is not ready for a female president”, but it appears he does not believe the country is ready for another president at all. The following months may radically change the region, so what can be expected for the future of Belarus?\nThe Lukashenko Ideology President Alexander Lukashenko. Credits to Reuters. ***Need to eliminate Reuters, Getty Images, AFP and replace with Creative Commons if possible.\nAlexander Lukashenko, sometimes called by western observers as the “Last Dictator of Europe”, is a former kolkhoz (Soviet collective farm) director. He was elected Deputy Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus in 1990, gaining a reputation as a young anti-corruption crusader.\nLukashenko contrasted sharply with his political opponents: he was a young, dedicated, and strong man that could usher a new era for Belarus, but at the same time he refused to embrace market capitalism and the wave of liberalism. He was the figure that could protect Belarus from the social upheaval that engulfed other post-soviet republics.\nHe was elected in 1994 and is Belarus’ first and, to date, only president. Soon after taking power, he brought back much Soviet-era symbolism and institutional power. Lukashenko reverted the national flag to a variation of the soviet one, restored Russian as an official language, abolished local elections, and limited the right to buy or sell farmland. His constitutional reforms gave the president unparalleled political power, with a massive police apparatus - still called the KGB.\nThe Baltic States, which radically modernized their economies and joined the EU shortly after re-independence, experienced enormous growth in poverty as soviet factories were closed and the population emigrated to other EU countries. Belarus, on the other hand, lagged along with other post-Soviet economies. GPD, Economic Growth, and Quality of Life in the country resemble their final Soviet years, but this has prevented economic and social inequality.\nGDP per Capita (PPP) in post-soviet economies based on the International Monetary Fund\u0026rsquo;s World Economic Outlook (WEO) Database, October 2015 Edition, by Heycci.\nUnder his rule, the Belarusians didn’t lose their jobs after independence. However, its slow, incomplete, transition to capitalism also kept industries under semi-government control, reducing poverty - which is estimated to be 0.8%, a figure smaller than any of its post-soviet friends. This slow but stable growth made Lukashenko a popular figure amongst workers and farmers.\nPoverty rates in post-soviet economies. Credits to Marc Champion and Aliaksandr Kudrytski.\nBut, by keeping the soviet structure of government to stabilize the economy came at the cost of liberty. The reduction of poverty meant it was necessary to tightly control the country, and therefore, it was necessary to suppress opposition and change. Suppressing opposition and change meant controlling the country, and the cycle continued.\nToday, Belarus not only has poor dynamism in the economy but also poor political pluralism. Lukashenko’s policies are often described as “stale and stable”, the country has improved very little since 1991, but by avoiding the economic and political chaos of Ukraine or poverty rates of the Baltics he gained the loyalty of the working class, older generations, and government officials. His decisions, however, sidelined the new, growing middle class.\nBela-Russia Lukashenko’s refusal to change comes at the cost of geopolitics. By prohibiting a dynamic, market-oriented market, the economy remains completely tied to Russia, which buys almost half of all Belarus’ exports. The country also is heavily dependent on Russian trade subsidizes, such as oil (for which it pays 80% of the international prices) and natural gas (for which it pays half the market price).\nRussia controls such soft power over Belarus that it could create a crisis by stanching economic trade. In 2020 New Year’s Eve, as a backlash for not supporting integration with Russia, the Kremlin cut oil exports for 5 days, creating a shortage of oil and energy in Belarus.\nBelarus kept itself in Russia’s sphere of influence as a way to appease this giant power, going so far as proclaiming the “Union State of Russia and Belarus”, one of the many post-soviet webs of trade and foreign relations. Like Soviet control of Finnish foreign policy in the cold war (described as “Finlandization”), Lukashenko complied in some things and pushed back on others, trying to maintain his balance in this tightrope.\nRelations of the supranational organizations in the post-soviet shere, by Aris Katsaris\nLukashenko’s good economic relations with Russia kept the country from avoiding the Russian sanctions, political interference, and territorial dismemberment that befell countries like Ukraine and Georgia. But as a result of the Russian economic downturn that began in 2014, planned tax changes will make the country pay full price for Russian commodities by 2025.\nLukashenko’s “neutrality” is threatened, as keeping good economic relations with Russia means exchanging national sovereignty. Russia has since 2019 pushed for closer integration, control over foreign policy, and even demanded the opening Russian military bases in Belarus. Lukashenko cannot refuse the Kremlin’s offer without bringing the same punishments brought upon Ukraine or Georgia.\nBelarus also regards Russia as its only alternative to the politically liberal European Union. For trade deals, the country would have to modernize its outdated political machinery and curtail its human rights abuses to fit European standards. Its southern neighbor, Ukraine, experimented more extensively with liberal and democratic ideals and tried closer ties to the EU, suffered the consequences in form of social upheaval and armed conflict.\nThe International Players Until 1991, Belarus never had an independent state (excluding a brief moment after World War I). It sits on the frontier of the European Union, NATO, and Russia. Its location in the middle of the European Plain - a prime location for army movement - has made the region see countless wars in history.\nIt is unfair to compare Russia (a country) with the EU (an economic block) and NATO (a military alliance), but the past decade has demonstrated that the balance between the “western” sphere of influence and Russia can cause armed conflicts, such as Georgia in 2008 (NATO influence vs. Russia backed separatists) and Ukraine in 2014 (EU influence vs. Russia backed separatists). As it stands today, the three international players have the following objectives in Belarus:\nThe European Union: although the European Union appears to have the same goals as NATO, it does not. By referring to the “European Union,” this article is referring to social and cultural ideas – mainly supported by France and Germany – of liberalism and reduced political oppression. The European influence comes in the form of economic trade deals and international rulings.\nInternal bureaucracy and lack of political will make it unlikely that the EU will support Belarus in any significant form. For France and Germany, should Belarus ever fall to armed conflict, Poland still acts as a buffer zone. At most, the leading EU countries would apply sanctions on Russia, as it did in when it invaded Ukraine, but no more can be expected.\nNATO: NATO sees Belarus as a pivotal player in the region. Its central location between means Belarus can seal off the Baltic States from Europe, threaten Poland, and control northern Ukraine. Whoever controls Belarus controls whether that country is a strategic asset or a strategic liability, and if the country falls into civil strife or armed conflict, NATO’s position in eastern Europe is compromised. A mass influx of migrants, border violence, and political shockwaves would destabilize the region.\nThe military alliances of NATO and CSTO in Eastern Europe, by Stratfor.\nRussia: Russia under Putin pursues a path to restore its former geopolitical power and influence, lost after the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia fears being surrounded and isolated from Europe as NATO and the EU enlarge their spheres, taking post-soviet countries. Russia needs Belarus not only as a buffer zone but as an ally, since closing the Suwalki Gap (shown in the map above) works as a deterrence to NATO actions in the region. Russia’s soft power has since been strained by international sanctions applied in 2014 and this may force the Russian government to curtail Belarusian privileges and expect greater Belarusian cooperation.\nIn the past decade, the three international players tried to maintain the balance of power in Belarus to avoid escalation. This Realpolitik worked well under Lukashenko’s neutrality but this tightrope is being threatened as the internal politics may soon change drastically.\nThis apprehension about the future of Belarus was brought to the forefront on July 29th, when 32 Russian Private Military Contractors were arrested in Minsk. Even if their true mission was not related to Belarus (a similar event happened in 2017), the incident has raised tensions between Belarus, Russia, and NATO. Incidents like this highlight how internal or international actions might make a domino effect in the country.\nThe Elections and the Opposition The opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP\nThe official results show the winner as Lukashenko, with 80% of the vote. Many doubts, however, were raised about the results, as Lukashenko himself admitted to changing the results in 2006.\nThe true percentage of Lukashenko is unknown, since independent opinion polls - even online surveys - are prohibited. While he certainly has a strong base of support among the elites and the older workers, he never achieved great popularity among the middle class and younger voters. For the first time, those already born in the Lukashenko-era can vote.\nHis opponent in this election was Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a former English teacher and stay-at-home mother of 2 with no experience in politics. She made her presidential bid after her husband was arrested in May 2020, for political activism. Her “outsider stance” from traditional Belarusian politics and grassroots campaign made her prominent and attracted international attention.\nThe opposition parties in Belarus exist in paper only, as leading figures and political activists have been arrested or fled the country. Svetlana was an exception since Lukashenko did not believe she could seriously challenge his reign, going as far as declaring that the country was not ready for a female president. Svetlana has since left the country and will probably not take further part in politics, but her impact is permanent.\nLukashenko’s commentaries, the government’s declared sabotage of her campaign, and her charming naivité made Svetlana a symbolic figure to the people. But Svetlana’s rise also meant the many opposition factions had to revolve around a single idea: removing Lukashenko. The protests that followed the elections are a result of the same, single, idea. This means the opposition has no agreement in even the most basic policies if they ever come to power.\nIt is possible to label the current political camps in Belarus: pro-western liberals, pro-Russian hardliners, soviet nostalgics, and the like. However, by clustering the rival political camps, we fail to see the fundamental internal working of a society like Belarus.\nCharles King, analyzing Andrei Almarik’s predictions on the fall of the Soviet Union, came to a wise conclusion: “A better way to think about political cleavages was to observe which portions of society are most threatened by change and which ones seek to hasten it—and then to imagine how states might manage the differences between the two. (\u0026hellip;) Where is the breaking point? How long can a political system seek to remake itself before triggering one of two reactions—a devastating backlash from those most threatened by change or a realization by the change-makers that their goals can no longer be realized within the institutions and ideologies of the present order?”\nIn the past 26 years, the Belarusian economy has been safeguarded from instability, the old methods of political repression are now too rusty to work and too inhuman to be ignored. Capitalism, as incomplete as it is in Belarus, has created a complex web of classes and ideas, forefronted by a young middle class. As long as Belarus had a minimal, but identifiable growth in quality of life, Belarusians could believe in the gradual change and reform.\nHowever, the economic stagnation and a disastrous coronavirus response showed how little the government can deliver. Lukashenko might further unnerve the population if the elections are proved to be rigged. The repression against the protest demonstrates that, so far, the Belarusian system cannot change. It remains to be seen if the majority of the population realizes protesting is not enough to change, and if an escalation of violence is the answer.\nFuture Scenario: Will it be like Ukraine? The Ukrainian Maidan that deposed president Yanukovych. By Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images file\nLukashenko is dealing with the protests, so far, in the same manner he always dealt with political opposition: police crackdowns. While he accused the opposition of fermenting a \u0026ldquo;Maidan\u0026rdquo; (a reference to the violent clashes between protesters and the government in 2014 that toppled president Yanukovych in Ukraine), his KGB security forces have violently put down protesters. Lukashenko, despite wishing not to escalate the unrest, has no other way to deal with the protests.\nHe also cannot let them take power in any form, since it would mean judicial investigations against him and his government. Not only is his position as president in peril, as is his freedom. His only solution in this case would be exile in Russia, however, Moscow would not be very content in taking the man who jeopardized their efforts in the region.\nIt is still too early to predict an escalation of nation-wide protests like in Ukraine, while there is enough incentive (a violent police force and a population in uproar, organized through social media), but the particularities that led to a Maidan in Ukraine are not the same in Belarus.\nThe only way for a Ukraine-like Maidan to occur is if the factory workers and small farmers, mentioned before, decide to support the opposition, however, they still have a fresh memory of the chaos that followed Ukraine in 2014. These workers will probably choose the faithful stability of the past. Lukashenko also has a stronger base of support in the elites and government (especially the military) built over the past 26 years, with a better (and more controlled) economy - a privilege Yanukovych did not have. His KGB is bigger and more loyal than the Ukrainian Berkut.\nEven with the odds against it, if the protests in Minsk somehow grow bigger and topple Lukashenko, then the following months will be even more chaotic than 2014 due to two major factors:\nThe Opposition Factionalism: As mentioned before, the current movement has the single goal of removing Lukashenko. If he is removed, the different factions will divide and struggle for power. This will become clear as “western” factions of the opposition will pursue closer ties with NATO and EU to protect Belarus, while “Russian” factions will try to maintain the ties with Russia without Lukashenko. In Ukraine, while the opposition wanted to remove Yanukovych, they also rallied behind the failed EU-Ukraine agreement, this led to more unified “pro-western” opposition.\nLinguistic and Ethnic differences: The linguistic and ethnic “contrast” in Ukraine is also starkly different from Belarus. While Crimea and Eastern Ukraine formed two contiguous Russian-ethnic populations, Belarus is a mix of Belarusian and Russian regions. When Ukraine drifted apart from Russia in 2014, Russia launched operations to back ethnic Russian or Russian speaking separatists in those regions. There’s no easy way to divide Belarus between “Belarusian” or “Russian” areas. This makes small annexations like Crimea harder for Russia but surely makes a nation-wide takeover easier.\nEthnic Russians and Russian speaking citizens in Belarus and Ukraine, by RFE.\nAs said before, it is still too early to believe a Maidan would happen in Belarus. While neighbors, the same revolution in Ukraine and Belarus could have two very different outcomes. The 2020 protests may lead to major changes in Belarus, but the power struggle and restructuring of society will bring uncertain years of unemployment and economic downturn.\nThis will fracture the opposition and will make Russian backlash and interference easier. Even if an opposition government takes place, there’s a considerable chance that in the 2024 elections a “Lukashenkean” figure will run, reminding people of “the good old days” - and win.\nFuture scenario: Will it be like Venezuela? The year is 202_. The protests in 2020 were short-lived and soon Belarus is quiet again, Lukashenko has used the last years in the same way he used his past 26 in power: stale but stable. He then announces his exit from the government, and in his place another government worker takes place.\nThis is a very likely scenario because of the governmental control over life and his power against the opposition parties. However, Lukashenko cannot hold his power much longer due to the economic recession and the rise of oil and gas prices. He does not have the ideological power to make his ruling elites and government officials loyal.\nHis successor will work as a scapegoat. The rising cost of energy would make industries lay off workers. The economic stagnation would then turn into recession as poverty rates rise and pensions are lowered. The economic downturn leftover by Lukashenko will turn his successor into a Maduro-like figure, and Lukashenko will be remembered as a prosperous president.\nFor Russia, with or without Lukashenko, this outcome is still positive, since it would rather have a chaotic Belarus as a buffer state than see it drift into a western sphere of influence. Russia could even try to reduce pressure in unification and extend economic help if it kept reformers from rising in neighboring countries.\nYet, in the long term, this scenario is still unstable. Lukashenko’s successor would struggle to keep the same elites and government officials in check. If another wave of civil unrest begins, a power struggle inside the government would ensue. Medium-level government officials would try to pursue a union with Russia if it meant keeping their jobs and privileges, but this would also mean high-level government officials would lose their jobs.\nA variation of this scenario is if Lukashenko himself is still in power when the economic downturn and government power struggle. Lukashenko or not, the chaotic outcome is still the same.\nConclusion Wishful thinking and personal biases can lead to very wrong conclusions. Predicting the future is an ungrateful duty - yet, in geopolitics, it must be done anyway. Lukashenko’s Belarus has many times before defied outsider spectators, who tried to predict his downfall and might continue to defy in the following years.\nHowever, it is undeniable that in the long-term Belarus stands in a crossroads: its internal politics will be stressed by prolonged economic stagnation and the international dispute between NATO/EU and Russia for Eastern Europe.\tThe fate of Belarus is unknown, but the decisions taken in Minsk, either by protesters or the government, can bring great consequences to the region.\nLukashenko is the exemplary long-time strongman president, and if his government falls, what can be said about other countries like Russia, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela? On the other hand, if the protesters fail and Lukashenko outlives his crisis, then his government will be a model for others, and will raise doubts in other post-soviet countries that strayed away from the Soviet and Russian influence. The consequences are enormous.\nBy Andreis Purim\n Sources:\n Gennady Rudkevich (2020), ‘A Color Revolution in Belarus?

The move was lambasted by those on the left and right alike, and indeed, at face value, it appeared counterintuitive. Any return to the Obama and Bush-era troop drawdown in Europe would be foolish facing a revisionist Russia. But if there is anything the keen and impartial observer should know by now about this administration, it is that it keeps its cards close to the chest, absorbing the criticism that inevitably comes and only revealing its end game down the line.\nWithin weeks, it was announced that an additional 1,000 troops could be deployed to Poland on top of the already agreed upon 1,000 from last year’s Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation. President Trump further intimated that more could follow. Likewise, Latvia announced that it wanted and was ready to accommodate a cut of the 9,500 leaving Germany as well. Likewise, Lithuania will be receiving hundreds of U.S. troops, including a battalion sized unit this year and a company of troops in 2022. Eventually, the Baltics may see an increased U.S. troop presence as well. On July 29, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper noted that the U.S. is considering bolstering its presence in the Baltic States, and the idea is gaining traction in the U.S. defense community. It is still not yet known what will become of the remainder of these troops – where they will be going and what they will be doing there. But we are likely beginning to see a potential strategic shift by the U.S. closer to NATO’s eastern flank.\nMuch ink has been spilled about how President Trump is angry with Germany’s failure to uphold the two percent defense spending agreement in NATO. A little less has been devoted to his remarks regarding Germany’s continued pursual of Nord Stream II and closer economic relations with Russia. All of these political/diplomatic messages matter, to be sure, but what of the strategic picture? In the event of conflict, it will matter less why the troops are where they are, and more that they are where they are. The reality is this: unless Poland falls, Germany is not likely to be a frontline ally. Poland is.\nDuring the Cold War, West Germany was NATO’s primary Eastern boundary (Greece and Turkey also bordered the Warsaw Pact, but these zones were not as militarized). It made sense for the allies to maintain a significant military frontline presence there, facing off the Warsaw Pact. Both sides focused considerable energy on plans and preparations for invasion scenarios centered on the Fulda Gap, today in the center of reunified Germany. Today, the United States’ military presence in western Germany is far from the front line. Russian strategy tells us that this makes a difference.\nFulda Gap Deployments ca. 1985 – Creative Commons illustration by W.B. Wilson.\nRussia is often viewed one of two ways: as a paranoid defender, facing off the specter of Western invasion, or as an opportunist, seeking to make gains in power where it is able. In reality, Russia is both of these at once. Its deluded fears of the West drive its desire for a buffer zone it can control in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, as well as its desire to prevent the spread of NATO to Ukraine and Georgia. Yet, in its conflicts in Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia, there is a clear sense of opportunism. Russia attacked swiftly in times and locations where it calculated the West would not respond strongly. To this day, Moldova’s Transnistria barely registers on anyone’s foreign policy radar in the West. Russia attacked Georgia during a lame duck presidency in an election year while the U.S. was focused on Islamist terrorism. When Russia attacked Crimea, it knew the U.S. was not particularly interested in Europe, and indeed, the U.S. still naively believed a reset with Russia could be possible. For nearly six years, the United States and Europe have done little beyond economic sanctions to seriously punish Russia or help Ukraine. Indeed, France and Germany have poised themselves to give Russia what it wants out of the protracted conflict in the Donbass with the Steinmeier Formula.\nIn each of these cases, the Kremlin saw an opportunity to maintain its sphere of control through protracted armed conflict. But ultimately the strongest piece of evidence that Russia views conventional conflict primarily through the lens of opportunity is this: Russia invests most of its military resources towards offensive capabilities and tends to see purely defensive capabilities as cost prohibitive. This is further underscored by comments by Valeriy Gerasimov, Chief of the Russian General Staff, in a March 2019 speech. He emphasized that Russia sees deterrence through the lens of preemptive strike, designed to seize the initiative to destroy the enemy before it can take the initiative to launch its own attack.\nThis line of thinking can also be seen in Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy, in which the Kremlin seeks to destabilize and neutralize perceived threats from the West, without having to fight a conventional conflict. Strategically, Russia understands that it cannot defeat NATO in the long run in conventional war. Without wearing NATO down beforehand, setting up a fait accompli, or pursuing an “escalate to deescalate” nuclear strategy, Russia does not have the resources to defeat NATO in personnel, money, or equipment. Thus, it takes the initiative to wage asymmetric conflict in the grey zone in order to weaken NATO while economizing the use of force.\nTaking Russia’s interestingly offensive deterrence strategy into perspective, NATO must recognize the need to deny Russia any opportunity for military action against member states along the Eastern Flank. As a result, a more forward presence is required than the current status quo. Facing renewed great power competition, and knowing that Russia clearly rejects the principles of the post-Cold War order, NATO should be prepared for the need to rapidly respond to a crisis in the east. For now, the threat has remained fairly low, but ensuring that Russia understands it cannot make a preemptive strike on the Baltics, Poland, or any other NATO member is critical.\nMany have suggested that a more forward posture could provoke a desperate Russia, resulting in the escalation of conflict. What we must understand, however, is that the conflict is already ongoing and is in a state of continuously fluctuating intensity. By deploying troops and equipment further east, the U.S. and NATO can simultaneously be prepared for a more rapid response to ensure no fait accompli can be achieved while signaling to Russia that the cost of aggression will be too high.\nSource: U.S. Embassy Poland\nThus, moving troops from Germany to Poland makes strategic sense, regardless of outwardly stated objectives. It will be potentially costly, yes, but if the United States and NATO want to prevent a fait accompli in the Baltics, positioning troops and equipment in closer proximity to the Suwałki Gap (on the Polish-Lithuanian border) is crucial for the allies to come aid the Baltics quickly and prevent Russia from isolating them. The key to success in this, however, is a combination of clear strategic thinking at the upper levels and clear messaging to Russia. NATO should seek to put forth not necessarily the greatest number of troops, but the troops and equipment best suited for rapid response as a first wave into the Baltic theater, allowing for a second wave to follow from bases in Germany and beyond. Ideally, this should not involve any significant troop reduction in Europe as a whole; indeed, it may be better to increase the number of troops there. However, the numbers themselves ultimately matter less than the capabilities NATO possesses.\nMuch remains to be seen with respect to how many troops will be deploying further east. How many will go to Poland? Will Latvia receive any of the troops it wants? What kinds of capabilities will the U.S. focus on sending eastward? Whether or not this turns out to be good policy largely hinges on the answers to these questions. Do not expect answers soon, but keep observing. The U.S. may not be washing its hands of Europe after all. In fact, it is probably renewing its focus – this time to the east.\nCover Photo: U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Poland\u0026rsquo;s President Andrzej Duda.

Though not as grandiose in scale as a May 3rd article in Izvestia would suggest, the exercises do demonstrate that Russia is working to practice its maritime capabilities. The main events of the exercises centered around what may have been two amphibious landing drills and also featured anti-aircraft and anti-submarine drills, simulated naval missile attacks, simulated aerial attacks on naval vessels, and mine-laying and mine-clearing exercises. The possibility of two amphibious landing drills aside, much of the events of late April would appear fairly routine; however, they underscore the Baltic States’ need for improvements in maritime capabilities to deter and defend against Russian aggression from the sea.\nLast September, Baltic Security Foundation published an article highlighting the deficiencies in the Baltic States’ maritime capabilities. Over the decades since re-independence, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all placed the greatest emphasis on a land-based deterrence strategy, neglecting the maritime domain. As a result, they have had no clarity in maritime strategy and have made little progress towards being able to effectively secure their coasts. They lack critical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and do not have 24/7 shared situational awareness at sea. They lack the ability to prevent Russian power projection into their territorial waters, port facilities, exclusive economic zones, or other littoral areas, and they cannot prevent Russia from temporarily taking control of these areas. Furthermore, much of their critical infrastructure is within the maritime domain, from undersea communications cables to gas interconnectors and onshore facilities such as the Klaipėda LNG terminal. These are poorly guarded, if at all, and are vulnerable to attack.\nMeanwhile, Russian capabilities are not overly impressive either, compared with say, the U.S. or British navies, but Russia’s Baltic Sea Fleet is certainly capable of maintaining the status quo, harassment, grey-zone operations, and surprise offensive action. Given the Baltic States’ lack of preparedness to prevent such actions, this condition suits the Russians just fine. In the event of aggression, Russia can still easily marry the capabilities it has at sea, say for example surprise offensive action in the form of an amphibious landing, with its capabilities on land to attack from multiple angles. Further, Russian anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities and the fact that the Baltic Sea is well-suited for mine warfare will complicate NATO reinforcement by sea.\nAs alluded to earlier, perhaps the most curious part of the Kaliningrad exercises is the two amphibious landing drills. Because of the shallow waters along the coasts, and because these coastlines are not well marked in the Baltic States, amphibious landings are rather difficult to pull off quickly, reducing their effectiveness. But, with quality intelligence on the seabed and coastal geography, they can be done. Further, if Russia can take control of any of the many islands that channel naval traffic into narrow lanes, it can more effectively cut off those lanes to others should it desire. Though amphibious landings can have defensive uses for reinforcement and supply, their primary purpose is offensive, either to invade or to push an invader back. As Russia has long been aggressive in its use of grey-zone operations in the Baltic Sea, it should be no surprise that Russia understands the limitations of other Baltic Sea states’ capabilities in the maritime domain. Nor should it be a surprise that it seeks to exploit them. If Russia were to decide to attack from multiple angles, it is reasonable that it should seek to perfect its amphibious capabilities in Kaliningrad, which is a key component of the Baltic operational environment.\nIf indeed Russia did practice amphibious landings twice in late April, as the Russian Defense Ministry website suggests, then this should give some insight into Russian strategic thinking in the Baltic Sea theater. Even without this curiosity, these exercises would be a reminder that the maritime domain contains critical weaknesses for the Baltic States which need to be addressed, not the least of which are the lack of ISR capabilities and the vulnerability of critical infrastructures which can be exploited to disrupt communications and energy supply and destabilize society. But now that we have seen these rehearsals, we must further take into consideration the possibility of attacks from the sea as well as over land. As such, this underscores the need for a coherent naval strategy among the three Baltic States and their NATO allies, as well as greater cooperation in situational awareness with Sweden and Finland. Should Russian naval exercises continue to put such emphasis on amphibious landings, this will be a clear indicator that Russia intends to put this strategy to use in theater. It is time to take the maritime domain seriously.\nCover Photo: Amphibious landing exercises in Kaliningrad Oblast, April 21 (Source: mil.ru, accessed via the Jamestown Foundation, https://jamestown.org/program/recent-military-exercises-in-kaliningrad-oblast-a-miniature-zapad/)\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/military_exercises_in_kaliningrad_highlight_maritime_threats/","tags":["Russia","Naval"],"title":"Military Exercises in Kaliningrad Highlight Maritime Threats"},{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"Each year, Estonia hosts Spring Storm (Kevadtorm), bringing together forces from all across NATO to conduct field and live-fire exercises. Though smaller in scale and participation due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s exercises concluded successfully last week. Spring Storm demonstrates Estonia and its allies’ commitment to ensuring readiness in case of attack, contributing to the credibility of NATO’s deterrence posture on the Eastern Flank.\nMilitary exercises are crucial for training and readiness purposes, as new conscripts/recruits and reservists have an opportunity to train alongside active duty personnel. Likewise, these exercises, if put together well, provide insight into the particular advantages and disadvantages the battle space provides while also forcing organizers to think critically about realistic battle scenarios. In turn, this should inform decisions on strengths and weaknesses and help decision makers strategize procurements and formulate better response plans.\nExercises also perform a critical deterrent role. A more prepared military force is a more difficult force to defeat, and therefore less enticing to attack. In a Baltic scenario, this is even more pronounced as the defenders will be a multinational force, presenting unique challenges for command and operations. Thus, NATO must be prepared to overcome these hurdles, and this can only be done through strategic planning and extensive practice putting plans into action. The more NATO is prepared to respond in a quick and coordinated manner, the better its deterrent posture will be.\nThough reduced to about a third of its scale this year, participants in Spring Storm included the United Kingdom, Denmark, the United States, the enhanced forward presence (eFP) battle group stationed in Estonia, and, of course, the Estonian Defence Forces (EDF). The Estonian Cyber Command, Air Force, and Military Police also took part in the exercises. During the field exercises at the first half of Spring Storm, the NATO allied battle group performed a red-teaming role as the enemy force. The American contribution consisted of two B-1 heavy bombers making the trip to Estonia from the continental United States as part of a 24-hour mission to practice rapid crisis response. British, Danish, and Estonian troops saw the bulk of the action this year, which largely focused on woodland infantry tactics and featured 150 units of military vehicles and equipment. The focus on woodland infantry tactics here is critical, as aside from urban scenarios in the north, infantry and combined arms operations in Estonia’s dense forests are the most likely forms of action on the ground that would be seen in the Estonian theater.\nPhoto credit: Ardi Hallismaa, accessed via ERR.ee\nThough reservists were unfortunately (and probably reasonably) unable to attend this year’s exercises, Spring Storm provided crucial training for new Estonian conscripts alongside their active duty counterparts. In order to be effective, conscripts must have training and experience. Otherwise, they may become a liability rather than a strength. As with any learned skills, military tactics and even the use of military equipment requires practice. Interoperability and the ability to effectively command multinational forces takes practice. Logistics for multinational forces in challenging geography take practice. Spring Storm demonstrates that Estonia takes its security seriously enough to train even now, albeit in a limited capacity. In turn, this willingness demonstrates to Russia that Estonia intends not to be easy pickings, and allied participation signals NATO members’ commitment to their allies’ defense.\nCover Photo: Danish troops participating in Spring Storm.

This will provide another moderate boost to the credibility of Estonia’s deterrent posture. These kinds of smaller procurements are an important part of the broader effort to build up a credible defense in case of Russian aggression and to signal that the risk outweighs the reward for attacking the Baltic States.\nYet, the numbers on this procurement highlight that while the region is perhaps best viewed as a single battle space, and while the three countries are stronger when they work together, each has different concerns based on individual characteristics. For Estonia, large scale tank warfare is not as reasonable a concern as it is for Lithuania. Here, geography plays a key role in determining how highly each state should prioritize anti-tank capabilities.\nFor Estonia, the primary concern for tank warfare will be along highways and in urban centers. Most likely this will be centered along the Narva-Rakvere-Tallinn route. But, in this environment, tanks will likely have less of an impact, as they are not well suited to fighting in built-up areas with limited space. Likewise, tanks are more vulnerable to anti-tank defenses in such environments. For Estonia, the forests, wetlands, and various hilly areas leave little open room for tanks to maneuver, pushing them to other areas where they will likely only play a supporting role.\nSource: CIA World Factbook 2011, created by Wikipedia user Radom1967 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0\nThough flatter, Latvia is just heavily forested as Estonia. For it, the primary concerns will be along highways, urban areas, and in the open fields of Zemgale. Parts of Latgale to the southeast may also be suitable for tank action. In Vidzeme, dense forests make the region unsuitable for tank warfare, and along the coast in the north, wetlands present an obstacle to tanks, pushing them to the road. This continues in Estonia, leaving tanks limited in their usefulness to the north. In February of 2018, Latvia signed a €108 million deal with EuroSpike for Spike anti-tank missiles. These missiles will also be installed on Latvia’s CVR(T) vehicles. For Latvia, the primary concern is to the south and southeast and along the Via Baltica highway to Rīga. But, unless an attack were launched in Latgale from within Belarus or Russia, Latvia’s chances of seeing tank warfare are largely dependent on Russian tanks’ success or failure in Lithuania.\nFor Lithuania, tank warfare is a very real and likely threat. Of the three Baltic countries, it has the longest ongoing cooperation with the United States on anti-tank missile procurements going back to 2002, and in February of last year, Lithuania purchased an additional $20 million in Javelin missiles. The country has far less forest cover compared with the other two, and is largely flat in the central lowlands. Open fields provide the kind of maneuverability that tanks need to be effective. But, to the southeast, which would be the most likely approach for Russian tanks, the hills around Vilnius favor defense. Thus, NATO needs to be prepared in order to prevent the Russians from getting past these hills to the lowlands around Kaunas. At Kaunas, logistics overland via the Suwałki Gap could be cut off and the Russians could connect their supply lines to Kaliningrad.\nRussia maintains numerical superiority in tanks compared to NATO. Furthermore, Russian tanks are lighter weight than British or American tanks. For the Russians, tank divisions are a key strength, and as such will be used in the Baltic theater in the event of war, even though the theater as a whole is not well suited for them. Thus, they will likely seek to leverage that strength where it is most useful in Lithuania. For NATO and each of the three Baltic states themselves, anti-tank missiles, be they Javelins, Spikes, or Carl Gustavs, are a critical leveling force against Russia. Indeed, anti-tank capabilities will be critical for maintaining an open supply line along the Via Baltica until NATO can get its own tanks into the theater. Even then, anti-tank missiles will be a crucial component of NATO’s countermeasures against Russian forces.\nWith all this in mind, the Baltics should strategize which procurements should be made jointly, and which should be based on individual circumstances. The military and political leadership need to be thinking critically about individual strengths and weaknesses, both in capabilities and in geography. Procurements should be tailored to strategy, and should not be done without considering the forces, factors, and drivers within individual countries alongside the region as a whole. Here, intelligence and information sharing are also critical to developing a coherent strategy and defensive posture. In order to deter Russian attack, defensive abilities must be credible. In order for the Baltics to have more than just a “porcupine” defense, there needs to be more strategic and practical thinking from the top down. With this kind of coordinated effort, NATO could come in as defenders, rather than liberators. Without it, war will be much longer, and much more painful.\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/tank_warfare_baltics/","tags":["US","NATO","Transatlantic"],"title":"Javelin Deliveries and the Prospects of Tank Warfare in the Baltics"},{"categories":["Policy"],"contents":"Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would commit up to $1 Billion in support for the Three Seas Initiative. In so doing, Congress and the administration are providing much needed assistance toward developing the economic and security infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. This initiative, launched in 2015 by the Polish and Croatian presidents, aims to make Central Europe a “backbone of European resilience,” in the words of Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. If successful, the initiative will lead both to greater economic prosperity and interconnectedness with the rest of Europe, and will undercut Russian and Chinese pressure and influence.\nMore specifically, the Three Seas Initiative will correct infrastructural imbalance which runs on an almost entirely east-west axis. Old pipelines and highways primarily run east-west throughout Central Europe, once bringing Soviet oil and gas to Europe, and continuing to foster Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. By creating a north-south infrastructural axis, the Three Seas Initiative will break up what was once a Soviet tool of control and subjugation in Central Europe and support the development of energy, transportation, and even digital infrastructure in the region. This will create a more interconnected Europe, and a more self-sufficient Europe, or at very least a Europe with greater diversification of sources for all commodities.\nOne such project seeks to build a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in Krk, Croatia, which would be connected to the existing terminals in Klaipėda, Lithuania and Świnoujście, Poland with north-south pipelines. This will reduce the reliance on Russian gas imports in the region, weakening the diplomatic leverage Russia enjoys. Also, and of particular importance to the Baltics, the Polish-Lithuanian gas interconnector (GIPL) project and synchronization of the Baltic power grid with Continental Europe are listed as priority projects. These will foster diversification of gas resources and bring the Baltic power grid out from Moscow’s control where it currently sits under the old Soviet-era BRELL Agreement. By improving energy security in the region and reducing reliance on Russian supply, the Three Seas Initiative is an investment in both collective and national defense as well as economic growth.\nA sample of Three Seas Initiative projects, plus TANAP and Nord Stream. Source: GISreportsonline.com\nIn the transportation sector, Rail Baltica is a key project for Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The project’s aim is to integrate the Baltics’ rail system with Continental Europe, and involves laying European gauge track in a north-south route from Tallinn to Warsaw, via Rīga and Kaunas and with a short connecting jaunt to Vilnius. This project will provide a rail connection to North Sea ports in Western Europe, and will reduce reliance on the highway system for cargo and freight transport. Not only will this improve the flow of goods and people in the region, but it will also change the operational landscape logistically for NATO in the event of conflict.\nIn tandem with Rail Baltica, improvements to the “Via Baltica” highway route are listed as a priority project under the Three Seas Initiative. Presently, freight transport accounts for approximately a 30 percent share of all traffic along the route, and in the case of Lithuania, 90 percent of all freight between Lithuania and the rest of Europe travels by road. Under the status quo, the road system is inadequate for demand in freight and passenger travel. Rail Baltica should alleviate some of the problem, but this corridor remains a critical artery for both commerce and defense. Upgrades, therefore, are a key interest for national security purposes as well, expediting movements of troops and supplies. Other transport projects, such as the Via Carpathia and a Baltic-Adriatic axis, will connect the Baltics to the Black Sea and Adriatic Sea, further erasing their relative isolation.\nFinally, with regard to digital infrastructure, the Three Seas Initiative includes projects on digital trade, research collaboration, and an ambitious plan to link communications infrastructure, fiber optics, and eventually 5G technology infrastructure, dubbed the “Three Seas Digital Highway.” 5G infrastructure is a major issue at stake here, as the Chinese are key competitors in the game, and there is grave concern that Chinese 5G systems will ultimately serve as tools of espionage and subversion. As such, investing in telecommunications and 5G infrastructure without going to the Chinese regime to buy it is prudent to protect security in the cyber-domain across the region.\nThe Three Seas Initiative consists of twelve members: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania. All twelve are EU members, and with the exception of Austria, each are part of NATO as well. From an American perspective, the initiative is an extremely positive development. As Atlantic Council’s Ian Brzezinski points out, supporting the Three Seas Initiative falls squarely within current American strategy, “[providing] justified support for some of America’s closest allies,” “[reinforcing] Central European efforts to counter malign Russian and Chinese pressure and influence,” and providing tangible return on investment for Washington’s foreign policy objectives in the region. Early on, Washington’s enthusiastic support for the project led to skepticism from some Western European EU members, but these have also come on board as well. And with regard to the EU, Austria is a key player from the perspective of the United States and the allies on NATO’s Eastern Flank. By joining the project, Austria is positioning itself to reduce dependence on Russia for energy and to increase its economic connections to European states in the East. This changes the balance of diplomatic leverage in Vienna, and will have an impact on positions it takes within the EU. Another friendly voice in EU institutions will certainly be welcome for members such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.\nBy connecting Central and Eastern Europe along a north-south axis, the Three Seas Initiative will enhance security and end a legacy of Soviet subjugation that still effects Europe today. It is a step in the right direction for ensuring stability, prosperity, and freedom for posterity. In short, it is a no-brainer for its member states and the U.S. alike.\nCover Photo: Three Seas Initiative member states. Source: ceep.be\n Sources:\nPress Release, Atlantic Council.

Given that these two countries have a long tradition of close cooperation in military affairs, this seems fairly mundane. But these exercises were highly unusual, as Finland’s FNS Uusimaa took orders from Swedish naval command, and Sweden’s HMS Helsingborg received orders from Finland’s command center in Turku. This was the first time in the history of Finnish-Swedish naval cooperation that ships took orders from the opposite country’s command. While interoperability continues to be a buzzword throughout the Baltic Sea Region as countries prepare for scenarios of Russian aggression, switching commands remains uncommon, and indeed, questions about command structure abound.\nWhat, then, is the added value for this exercise? Anders Åkermark, representing the Swedish Naval Operations department, was quoted by News Now Finland saying, “it increases the credibility of both countries’ naval forces if we can lead each other’s vessels when needed and exchange information about the maritime situation.” This also parallels the idea that has been floating around of joint Finnish-Swedish brigades. In each case, Finland and Sweden have determined that pooling their resources will make their defenses more credible, deterring Russian attack.\nIn all maritime issues in the Baltic Sea Region, small countries’ limitations in manpower and financial resources present a key weakness. Even Finland and Sweden face the manpower gap, underscoring why both countries would seek to increase operability even so far as being able to take orders from the opposite command. The two, though they have long had amicable relations with NATO, are growing ever closer to the alliance and increasing cooperation with it. In the political realm, Sweden and Finland both are seeing a shift in attitude toward NATO membership as well. If Finland and Sweden were to join NATO, this would both facilitate cooperation on military operations throughout the Baltic Sea Region and bring the two ever closer to their partners in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\nSweden has increased cooperation with NATO in recent years. Photo source: nato.int\nIndeed, British military expert Glen Grant has argued that NATO should push for Finland and Sweden to join, as it would then legally obligate Stockholm and Helsinki to join the fight in the event of war in the Baltics. Apart from NATO, he argues, the two can be more easily cowed by Russia to stay out.\nOthers may argue that NATO accession for Finland and Sweden would be escalatory and prompt Russia to go on the attack. Though Russia would be expected to protest against NATO aggression in such an event, the reality is that NATO is a defensive alliance, and Russia’s fears are both baseless and, frankly little more that political grandstanding. Certainly Russia could use the usual line about NATO aggression as an excuse to go on the offensive, and as a tool to spin the narrative of just who started what, but it will nevertheless be a lie. Besides, in nuclear deterrence, there is the concept of “escalate to de-escalate,” raising the stake to the point where an adversary is less likely to deem the punishment worth the reward. The same applies here; two more militaries under NATO command, and all the manpower and weapons systems that go with it, will likely make Russia see merit in avoiding conventional conflict. Though hybrid warfare would likely intensify, the Baltic Sea Region is already a hotbed for such activity, and this would certainly be preferable to outright war anyhow.\nAs alluded to earlier, one of the key problems of joint operations and interoperability is the need for combatants to know just what is going on at any given moment. They need to know not only what the adversary is doing, but what their partners are doing. In order to do this, information sharing and situational awareness are critical. Throughout the Baltic Sea Region, nations are deficient in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the maritime domain. Likewise, the Baltic and Nordic countries need more flexible command and control structures and improved common coordination mechanisms to ensure the security of critical sea lines of communication and supply. These, too, will augment ISR needs, facilitating smoother operations. In all this, there is an implicit need for greater structural thinking both in national governments and among allies and strategic partners. Part and parcel of that, is the need for a cohesive and coherent strategy at the regional level to enhance and facilitate cooperation. Without structure and clearly defined roles and objectives, even the best laid plans descend into disaster.\nAll this brings up yet another question: how far should countries go pursuing interoperability? You can, after all, have too much of a good thing. This question needs to be considered, especially with regard to added value. If Latvia purchases an inferior, outdated tank, Lithuania should not purchase the same tank just because the two could swap mechanics. Two broken down tanks are always worse than one operational one. But, if both countries can make joint procurements of a superior tank, this would both positively impact interoperability and operational effectiveness. As in all things, there is a balance, and this balance will always be different for small countries with limited manpower and financial resources than it is for say, the United States. Strategic, structural, and tactical thinking needs to be lucid and organized, and no facet should supersede another lest it fall to the wayside.\nGreater cooperation between Finland and Sweden on military affairs reflects a newfound seriousness about defense matters in Helsinki and Stockholm. These two are an integral part of military operations in the Baltic Sea theater, and as such, this news is welcome on NATO’s northeastern flank. An increase in the deterrent capacity of both countries changes the strategic calculus in the region. Even more so, NATO accession would radically alter the operational theater, and the possibility should be given thorough consideration. But this is not the end; maritime capabilities, structures, and strategies all need serious improvements throughout the region. Without these, all the interoperability in the world will not save them. Indeed, for all its benefits, allies and partners in the region need to find the right balance on interoperability. Governments throughout the region must be willing to keep improving, with both the aim to prevent war and be prepared for it should it come. Complacency kills.\nCover image: FNS Uusimaa.

According to the signed act of affiliation, Lithuania’s Iron Wolf Mechanized Brigade and Poland’s 15th Mechanized Brigade will train jointly to prepare for operations in the Gap, though they will remain under their own national command. The framework for this cooperation has its origins just over a year ago with the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Defense Council, and this is its first concrete act. This agreement will allow for greater cooperation on defense and security related matters, such as coordination of defense plans and joint exercises. Grand comparisons to 15th and 16th Century battles against the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Moscow and even to the Cold War era Fulda Gap aside, this new development in Polish-Lithuanian cooperation is quite welcome in a region widely considered to be a weak spot for NATO.\nThe Suwałki Gap is the narrow Polish-Lithuanian border region sandwiched between Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus. This area is of critical logistical importance to NATO, seeing as it is the only land border between the three Baltic States and the rest of the alliance. Presently, it contains only two minor highways running in a general north-south direction, as well as some smaller local roads and roads used by the logging industry and forest services. As such, it could serve as a tactical chokepoint, wherein Russian forces could stymie troop and supply movements north. Maintaining control over the Suwałki Gap, therefore, is critical in the event of war in the Baltic Theater with Russia.\nThe Suwałki region, however, presents major advantages for defense and significant obstacles for offensive operations. If NATO can deny Russia access, it will be that much more difficult for Russian troops to launch an offensive campaign there. If, on the other hand, NATO does not deny Russia access, and Russia gains control in the region, it will be extraordinarily difficult for NATO to reopen the critical corridor from Suwałki to Kaunas in order to supply operations in the Baltics.\nThe terrain is heavily forested and hilly, and is dotted with lakes, rivers, and marshes. Forests and lakes comprise approximately 50 percent of the land area, while swamps form another 11 percent. The hills run latitudinally and are intersected by rivers and lakes. Moraine dammed lakes are generally shallow, widely dispersed, and have soft embankments, while step, high banks and irregular bottoms characterize local ribbon lakes. Rivers in the region flow northward, and are generally narrow and winding, with steep and heavily forested banks. Many of the coniferous forests in the region are practically impassible, and most are inaccessible (or at least foolhardy) terrain. Clay and sandy clay soils in the region make for impassible conditions in rainy weather with deep, dense, and soggy mud. And indeed, rainy weather is typical for much of the year from the spring thaws all the way to autumn. In the wintertime, snow and frost inhibit movement. Snow covers the ground an average of 90 days per year, heavy frost an average of 50 days, and 30 days see ground frost temperatures. Soils are frozen approximately 120 centimeters deep in the winter, but frozen lakes and rivers may be crossable. Furthermore, the limited road system in the region is poor, and many bridges can only sustain a weight of about 50 tons, which will support a Russian tank, but not an American or British tank, as these average about 70 tons. Though there are pontoon bridges, these are few in number and not suitable for the local rivers. Besides weight limitations, these roads will not sustain movements of larger military vehicles in formation, meaning such equipment would either be forced to find alternate routes or would be “canalized” into long, slow lines or short caravans with limited numbers, nullifying any numerical advantage offensive forces might have.\nMap of the Suwałki region and its physical characteristics.

(103), 2016.\nThe regional terrain and climate are atypical, and local operations will require specialized training and equipment. These conditions readily benefit defensive operations by creating natural defensive lines and allowing armies to restrict movement with limited force, especially if road infrastructure is destroyed. Defenders in the region can further limit maneuverability in a number of ways, including creating engineering obstacles, developing camouflage and deception components to inhibit air and land reconnaissance, and establishing combat support and combat service assets locally. Further, the terrain itself limits the ability to reorganize combat units and restricts logistical support to react to changes in the tactical situation. On the other hand, the terrain supports covert operations. As a result of limited lines of sight and likely robust covert scouting operations, artillery is also limited in its usefulness for offensive operations in the Suwałki region.\nTypical forest wetland landscape near Augustów. Source: augustow.pl\nTwo key considerations must be brought up here: first, NATO can gain a serious tactical advantage by investing in early warning capabilities, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and facilitating information sharing in the region; second, Russia cannot close the Suwałki Gap without involving Belarus somehow. Regarding the first, it is blatantly obvious that NATO can better secure the region by investing in capabilities which enhance situational awareness, but the result of that investment is the key here: greater awareness allows greater time to surge forces into the theater, putting NATO in position to take advantage of a defensive posture in a local environment wholly suited for defense. The second is a little less obvious, as Kaliningrad is itself heavily militarized, while Belarus is less so. But, in order to effectively close the Suwałki Gap, Russia must deploy missiles over or from Belarus, or must deploy troops through Belarus, or less likely, coerce Belarus into joining the fight. Otherwise, a Belarusian route around the Gap remains open in a conventional war scenario. Such moves would escalate the situation to a point where strikes on Kaliningrad, Russian forces in Belarus, or even to the main part of Russia itself would be justified. Belarus, especially as relations currently stand, will be reasonably reluctant to allow any of the above scenarios, and NATO forces could theoretically hold local Russian assets at risk, turning the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) balance in the region on its head against Moscow.\nThe Suwałki Gap presents both strategic challenges and strategic opportunities. If NATO can secure the Gap, it can maintain the vital overland supply line from Poland to the Baltics. Further, it can use the Gap to hamper Russian activities and capabilities around Kaliningrad and Belarus. From Polish acquisition of F-35 jets and Lithuanian acquisition of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), to cooperation on the joint Polish-Lithuanian brigade to defend the Suwałki Gap, we have seen many positive measures for improving regional defense. But there is certainly more work to be done. It would be reasonable to expand the number of joint brigades; one probably is not enough. Secondly, infrastructural improvements are needed to ensure NATO tanks can cross bridges safely. NATO should invest in air defense and surveillance systems, and should seek to improve situational awareness locally in the Suwałki region. Finally, NATO needs to train and prepare for operations in the unique conditions the terrain, soil, climate, and infrastructure provide in order to improve overall readiness. As the only land route between the Baltics and the rest of NATO, this small piece of territory bears outsized significance for military operations in the Baltic theater. NATO must maintain it.\nCover photo: NATO exercises in the Suwalki Gap Region. Published by NATO. Creative Commons. Credit  Sources:\nCol. Leszek Elak and Col.

A keen observer will notice that Alyaksandar Lukashenka’s Belarus is much the same. All too often, Western analysts have made the mistake of grossly oversimplifying Belarus’ relationship with Russia, as well as its domestic political affairs and broader foreign policy. This has led the West to neglect relations with Minsk, where despite a less than ideal government, great strategic opportunity lies, and where there is also significant strategic risk. The reality is this: Lukashenka is not simply Putin’s puppet in Minsk. He is concerned for his own nation’s sovereignty, and walks a thin tightrope in his relations with both Moscow and the West. Like him or not, there is no viable alternative to Lukashenka, and NATO needs a sovereign and neutral Belarus on the Baltics’ southeastern flank.\nRussia and Belarus have had extensive disagreements on economic matters. While Russia has largely been the economic lifeline for Minsk, and while Minsk has enjoyed huge subsidies on Russian gas, the special relationship between the two has largely gone sour. Arguments over energy prices, much of which center around the purported “oil tax maneuver,” in which Russia will reduce its “dotations” on Belarusian oil by lowering export duties while taxing resource extraction. This is estimated to result in critical losses to the Belarusian energy sector and will likely put significant strain on Belarus’ already weak economy. Likewise, Russia and Belarus have had major disagreements about the latter’s role in the Russian led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). In response, Lukashenka’s government has been seeking economic ties elsewhere, particularly China, the European Union, and Africa. Earlier this year, Lithuania and Poland were making overtures towards Minsk regarding trade in the energy sector, and Belarusian agricultural products reach E.U. markets regularly. However, a central pillar in Minsk’s future trade relations will most certainly be politics. Lukashenka sees too many political demands from both Russia and the E.U., and will increasingly seek to develop ties with the Chinese and with African nations such as Zimbabwe. Case in point, earlier this year Minsk began work on a deal to trade Belarusian heavy machinery for Zimbabwean diamonds and precious metals.\nBelarus’ relations with the West are just as complicated. Lukashenka has sought to balance cooperation with Western governments on the Northern Distribution Network during the war in Afghanistan and its role as a neutral mediator between Russia and Ukraine in the Minsk Accords against its staunch refusal to acquiesce to Western demands on democratic governance, human rights, and economic liberalization. From the American side, this has led to the imposition of sanctions on Belarus, along with numerous postponements of sanctions, and the two are only now ending an extended period of frosty diplomatic relations wherein Washington and Minsk did not exchange ambassadors.\nIn military affairs, Lukashenka’s tightrope becomes even more bizarre. While Russia and Belarus are friendly partners on paper, and while the two have enjoyed extensive military cooperation, notably in Russia’s Zapad (“West”) military exercises, Russia actively threatens Belarusian security. In response to Lukashenka’s gradual “soft-Belarusianization” and stubbornness on economic matters, Moscow has ramped up its campaign of hybrid warfare on Belarus, particularly with regard to disinformation. Further, many hardliners in the Russian political elite have called for a “Krymnash” (“Crimea is ours”) scenario for Belarus, wherein Belarus would be absorbed into the Russian state in much the same manner as Crimea. Even more, Russia has recently increased its troop presence in both Smolensk and Klintsy near the Belarusian border. Smolensk puts the Russians within a straight shot of Minsk by the E30 highway, along which there are few population centers to offer resistance. At Klintsy, the Russians are near the major Belarusian railway hub at Gomel’. This presence certainly increases the pressure on Minsk\nFor NATO, Belarus is a key strategic point on the Eastern Flank. A sovereign Belarus stands in the way of Russian aggression in the Baltic States. Should the Russians control Belarus, the Suwałki Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland between Belarus and Kaliningrad, could easily be sealed off, giving the Russians a key logistical advantage while denying land access to the Baltics by NATO reinforcements. Likewise, the current lack of Russian ground troops or air bases in Belarus is a key buffer between Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. By being de facto non-aligned, Belarus provides greater security on the Eastern Flank, allowing for continued NATO access to the Suwałki Gap. The strategic depth Belarus provides is clouded somewhat by its military and economic weakness should Russia decide to violate the former’s sovereignty, and this is precisely why relations with Minsk are taking on greater importance. Much as Western governments do not like the Lukashenka regime, and much as they are right not to, there are no viable alternatives that will maintain stability. The West, therefore, has to accept Lukashenka for who he is and encourage him to keep his country sovereign and neutral.\nCover Photo Credit: kremlin.ru\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/belarus_an_overlooked_key/","tags":["EU","NATO"],"title":"Belarus: An Overlooked Key to Baltic Security"},{"categories":["Activities"],"contents":"October 2019 has been busy for the Baltic Security Foundation, pursuing our goal of fostering and promoting Baltic defense and security. The team has both participated in and organized events covering regional security issues.\nThe Rīga Conference 2019 took place on October 11th and 12th. Mr. Olevs Nikers and Mr. Otto Tabuns were both invited to participate. The agenda included current challenges, such as the issue of EU and NATO identities as well as understanding European strategic autonomy. In a regional scope, the conference strongly emphasized the increasing importance of China and the Arctic region, and did not forget to keep Ukraine and Georgia on the agenda, too. Human rights and political power in the digital age formed another fundamental debate among the participants. In addition to the regular program, Mr. Tabuns was invited to moderate the Rīga Conference Future Leaders Forum that gathered 30 graduate students and young professionals from Europe, the U.S., and South Africa. They discussed the preconditions necessary for NATO to remain a relevant and modern alliance. The future leaders identified which NATO priorities are more important to them, personally, and worked on a set of recommendations for what the Alliance could do to obtain the necessary toolkit for it to succeed in the coming years. This is significant in understanding the certain different perspectives across the Transatlantic space, paving the way to common ground among the new generation of opinion and decision makers.\nBetween October 20th and 24th, BSF was honored to host Ms. Maia Otarashvili, a Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Eurasia Program at Foreign Policy Research Institute. She met the BSF team, as well as officials, diplomats, and scholars in Rīga. FPRI runs the Baltic Initiative, designed to advance Americans’ awareness of our region while providing a platform for voices from the region. The Initiative has launched a regular publication titled the Baltic Bulletin, which shares insights about the region with thousands of readers worldwide. The Initiative also organizes public events, and FPRI has supported the organization of AABS conference in Philadelphia. Therefore, Ms. Otarashvili’s visit is expected to strengthen networking between experts on the Baltic region across the Atlantic, especially beyond the Beltway in the U.S.\nOn October 23rd, BSF, in cooperation with BW Consulting, hosted another Baltic Sea Security Initiative Workshop in Berlin, Germany. Experts from Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States assessed the military aspects of Baltic Sea security. They devoted particular attention to the maritime and air domains, strategic and bureaucratic culture, national defense planning, and constitutional considerations. This will be used to formulate practical recommendations to Baltic and Allied decision makers.\nOn October 30th, BSF representatives were invited to participate in the Baltic Security Strategy Forum in Kiel. Hosted by the Institute of Security Policy by Christian Albrecht University in Kiel, the forum dealt with key regional issues in the maritime domain. The high level presenters, including many from the German, Swedish, and U.S. Navies, discussed Swedish-Finnish naval cooperation, gaps in Baltic naval cooperation with the rest of the NATO, and former Soviet naval offensive plans in the Baltic Sea in context of the Russian maritime strategy today.\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/regional_activities/","tags":["EU"],"title":"Regional Activities 2019"},{"categories":["Mobility"],"contents":"In October 2019, Baltic Security Foundation hosted Master of International Affairs students from Texas A\u0026amp;M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service for the Young Leaders Mobility Program in Rīga.

This second line would allow for additional gas flows directly from Russia to Western Europe up to a potential 110 billion cubic meters annually. At face value, this expansion is an economic opportunity that makes sense for Germany and other potential Western European customers. In a perfect world, it would be just that. Unfortunately, economic relations with Russia contain security risks. For precisely this reason, Nord Stream 2 faces opposition among Eastern European nations and the Baltic States, as well as from the United States. By cozying up to Russia for cheap gas, Germany is making a Faustian bargain that will not only endanger its allies to the east, but itself as well.\nRussia has long used energy supplies as a foreign policy tool. From the name of the Soviet-era Druzhba (“Friendship”) pipeline on up to Russia’s nearly annual cutting of Ukrainian gas supplies during the winter, it is clear that energy supply has been a key component of Moscow’s soft and hard power tactics alike. Likewise, in cases of “state capture,” the energy sector frequently plays a major role, as in Bulgaria. In Belarus, energy is front and center in disputes between Minsk and Moscow, as the latter seeks to coerce the former into falling in lock-step with the Kremlin’s policies and demands. For the Baltic States, the Soviet-era BRELL Agreement, which connects the electrical grids of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, and Russia synchronously, has given Moscow leverage since it controls the power supply. To their credit, the Baltic States have broken up Gazprom’s vertical monopoly in the regional gas market and have begun preparations to exit the BRELL Agreement, and these positive steps should serve as a model for others to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. But, as Europe’s dependence on foreign energy supplies continues to grow, many other European nations lack the political will to follow the Baltics’ lead, particularly those that do not share the threat perception evident in the east.\nEnergy has likewise served as a point of contention historically between the United States and the European allies. When Egypt, Jordan, and Syria attacked Israel during the 1967 Six Day War, the United States called upon the Europeans to support the Israelis. The Europeans, however, were not so keen to support Israel, even if they were sympathetic to the Israeli cause. For Britain, the decision to maintain a neutral, and even borderline pro-Arab stance, hinged on protecting its image among the Arab states in large part to secure oil supplies and retain Arab investment in British banks. In 2003, opponents of the Iraq War accused the United States of invading Iraq to secure its oil supplies, a refrain picked up by anti- American political leaders in Western Europe. Among these, Gerhard Schröder capitalized on the radical pacifism and anti-Americanism of the German left and excoriated the U.S. for Iraq, which he had previously supported. Now, Schröder, who has long been cozy with Putin, is Chairman of the Board for Nord Stream AG. This inspired the term Schroederizatsiya (“Schröderization”), which refers to the corruption of another country’s political elite. Alongside “state capture,” and often a key component of it, Schröderization is an important part of Russia’s broader hybrid warfare strategy.\nJust as in 2003, Germany and France once again are leading the anti-American bloc among the Europeans. These two are also united with the Kremlin on promoting the Steinmeier Formula for peace in Donetsk and Luhansk. Should the Steinmeier Formula be adopted in Ukraine, France and Germany would be responsible for legitimizing Russia’s actions not only in Ukraine, but in Georgia and Transnistria as well. With so little else in common with Russia, it is not difficult to ascertain that Germany and France have a vested interest in securing Russian energy supplies and are thus willing to side with the Kremlin against Ukraine, NATO allies along the Eastern Flank, and the United States.\nPhoto Credit: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\nWhat, then, does this all mean? Nord Stream 2, along with the southern Turk Stream route, will enable Russia to bypass old routes through Ukraine and Eastern Europe, ensuring a continuous stream of supply to Western European customers while at the same time denying that security to Eastern European nations that oppose Moscow. If Nord Stream 2 is completed, it will increase Western Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, giving Russia greater political and diplomatic leverage in its relations with those countries. While there has been much panic about divisions within NATO, the alliance has always experienced some disunity. But as many rush to defend the more complacent allies, such as Germany, they fail to realize the potential damage its recalcitrance may bring to the alliance. Though U.S. President Trump’s bluster may aggravate the Europeans, his administration has shown that in deed, the United States is hardly bent on retrenchment, and is in reality more committed to Europe than perhaps any other time since the Cold War. By cozying up to Russia on Nord Stream, however, Germany risks betraying its allies and increasing Russian influence at home. This dangerous policy alignment sets Germany down the path towards state capture and could do serious, lasting damage to NATO’s effectiveness as a defensive alliance.\nUnfortunately, what good news there was on stopping Nord Stream 2 took a decidedly negative turn this week. Along with U.S. sanctions on companies affiliated with Nord Stream, Denmark was holding up progress laying the pipeline through its territorial waters via its permitting process. The Danes have been key friends to the Baltic States since Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia regained independence in 1991. Unfortunately, Denmark approved the permits for Nord Stream 2 on Wednesday, October 30th. Should U.S. and other E.U. members’ efforts succeed in derailing Nord Stream 2, NATO can potentially avoid the situation outlined above. With Denmark’s efforts over, however, it is looking more and more bleak. Western Europe should seek instead to diversify its energy resources and where these resources come from. The Baltic model for greater self-sufficiency, coupled with American and South Korean partnerships on liquefied natural gas (LNG), serves as a potential pathway towards reducing dependence on Russian energy. Likewise, Poland has announced that it is cutting off Russian gas imports and instead turning towards the Norwegians, American LNG, and its own wells off the Norwegian coast. On energy, the Baltics and Poland serve as positive models to the rest of Europe: by reducing their dependence on Russian energy supplies, they remove political and diplomatic leverage from Moscow and reduce Russian influence on their governments. By choosing to pursue Nord Stream 2, however, Germany risks going the way of Bulgaria, where the energy sector is dominated by Gazprom and the political system now much more resembles that of Russia than when it first joined the European Union. Should Nord Stream 2 prevail, Germany will betray its allies and weaken the defensive alliance, dividing Europe between East and West once more.\nA single section of the pipeline remains incomplete around the Danish island of Bornholm, but Denmark approved the permits to build the pipeline on Wednesday, October 30. Photo credit: nord-stream2.com\nFor the Baltic States, Nord Stream 2 is not an immediate threat to their energy supplies. They have greatly reduced their dependence on Russia in the energy sector. Their primary concern regarding Russia’s ability to cut off their energy supplies is not the route those supplies take, but the insecurity of their infrastructure, as many cables are unburied and unhidden, and many onshore components are poorly guarded, if at all. Nord Stream 2 is, however, a grave threat to the Baltic States’ broader security. Should Germany be a whole nation “Schröderized,” NATO will have a difficult time coping politically. Worse than that, though, NATO logistics will risk being completely thrown off track. While this scenario seems unlikely to come into fruition completely in the near-term, some aspects of the scenario will. The radical pacifism of Germany’s left and center, as well as growing anti-Americanism, open the door for Russian influence in government. Increased dependence on Russian energy will open that door wider, making Germany an even weaker link in NATO than it already is. Many Western European nations that do not have such heightened threat perception with regard to Russia, and that have a greater affinity towards the German-led European Union over NATO, will be tempted to follow Germany’s lead. For Russia, a weakened NATO is an opportunity. For the Baltics, a weakened NATO is an existential threat.\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/stopping_nord_stream/","tags":["Energy"],"title":"Why Stopping Nord Stream 2 Matters for the Baltics"},{"categories":["Security"],"contents":"Maritime operations have once again been a major theme of recent headlines in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Following the NATO BALTOPS exercises this summer, repeated violations of the Baltic States’ airspace by Russia, and observing current combat diving operations in Tallinn Bay, maritime security issues are particularly relevant. Unfortunately, given the long-standing emphasis on land-based deterrence, the maritime domain has largely been neglected.\nBALTOPS 2019 revealed a key weakness for naval operations: the shallow and largely unmarked coastline hampered amphibious landing operations in Lithuania. Not only do these conditions make amphibious landing operations slower and more difficult, they even present major operational hazards. One Polish landing vessel reportedly ran aground during the exercises. While there is not much that can be done about shallow water, Lithuanian and U.S. forces have responded to these weaknesses by conducting coastal observation studies and exploring the seabed along the Lithuanian coast. Given that the Baltic States’ only land border with the rest of the alliance is the narrow Suwałki Gap on the Polish- Lithuanian border, NATO cannot rely on land connections for logistical support. As such, the ability to conduct amphibious landings with troops and supplies is vital.\nIt would be wonderful if a poorly marked coastline and shallow water were the only deficiencies in the Baltic States’ maritime defense. Unfortunately, the Baltic States lack the ability to prevent Russia from projecting power into their territorial waters, port facilities, exclusive economic zones, and other littoral areas. Furthermore, the Baltic States cannot prevent Russia from temporarily taking control of these areas. The Russian Baltic Sea fleet may not be overly large or impressive, but it is more than capable of maintaining the status quo, harassing military and civilian activity at sea, and taking surprise offensive action. After all, Russian naval harassment is not unknown – Lithuanian sailors laying the NordBalt cable were repeatedly antagonized by Russian ships – and grey zone operations are a key component of Russian strategy.\nThis situation only gets worse. The Baltic States are currently deficient in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities at sea. They do not have full, integrated, and shared awareness across the surface, subsurface, and air domains. Individual states’ capabilities vary, but Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all deficient at ISR in the maritime domain given the context of their current security environment. Likewise, the Baltic States have had varying levels of success with sharing information. As it stands, there is no full-time command center to process threats at sea and determine how to respond. The multiple recent violations of Baltic airspace by Russian military aircraft underscores the importance of ISR capabilities and information sharing between the Baltic States. In order to process and respond to threats, one first must know that they are there.\nYet more bad news: the maritime domain hosts several key components of the Baltic States’ critical energy and communications infrastructure. Undersea cables, gas interconnectors, and onshore facilities such as the Klaipėda LNG terminal are all vulnerable to attack. Many cables are unburied and unhidden, such as the NordBalt cable, which connects the Baltic and Nordic electricity markets. Likewise, many other infrastructural components are poorly guarded, if at all. These components create key weaknesses for Russia to exploit in the event of an attack. Cutting off gas or electricity supply will likely wear down societal resilience to propaganda, and will complicate military logistics and decision making as well.\nWith such a heavy focus over the last several years on land-based deterrence, the Baltic States have largely neglected the maritime domain. CPT Bill Combes (U.S. Navy, retired) refers to this condition as “sea-apathy,” and it has led to gaps in procurement, awareness, capabilities, and strategy. Many experts, such as Combes, have provided excellent suggestions to improve the situation. The author makes no attempt to claim the following recommendations as his own, but has selected those from other experts that he has deemed most practical and actionable:\nFirst: the Baltic States need to develop clear goals and a comprehensive maritime strategy. This strategy should identify important investments required for robust maritime domain awareness.\nSecond: in order to reduce costs and improve interoperability, the Baltic States should identify opportunities for joint procurements in maritime ISR technology.\nThird: the Baltic States need to implement a combined and cooperative Naval Operations Center in order to best focus individual maritime capabilities to mutual benefit and facilitate higher-end NATO operations. Further, the Baltic States should establish a joint Maritime Command Center which could identify and process threats and determine how best to respond.\nFinally: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia all need to focus on becoming effective “coastal powers,” as Combes calls it. Their navies do not need to be large and grandiose, but they do need to be able to protect infrastructural assets, trade, and communication in the maritime domain.\nThe current situation in the maritime domain is most certainly not ideal. However, it can be improved by taking practical steps like those outlined above and participating in ongoing NATO training exercises. The coast is a key component of the Baltic States’ security both in peace-time and in the event of war. As such, “sea-apathy” cannot remain a feature of the Baltic States’ defense posture.\nCover Photo: BALTOPS 2019 / Benas Gerdžiūnas / LRT\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/improving_maritime_security/","tags":["Naval"],"title":"Improving the Baltic States’ Maritime Security"},{"categories":["Activities"],"contents":"BSF President Mr. Olevs Nikers and BSF Director Mr. Otto Tabuns took part in the panel “Addressing Security Challenges in the Baltic Region through Multilateral Cooperation” of the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) 13th General Conference September 5, 2019 in Wrocław, Poland.\nDuring his presentation “Sub-Regional Defense Synchronization – Theory Perspectives and Security Expectations for the Baltics,” Mr. Nikers outlined and discussed the origin and sustainability of the modern security alliance between small countries. He focused on the Baltic States, and took the issue of alliance formation beyond the realm of Cold War-era power balancing, upon which the main alliance- building theory was formed.\nFrom one side, the presentation discussed current issues regarding the Baltic States’ security cooperation, which were identified and analyzed within the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2018-2019) by scholars and government professionals from the Baltic States. From the other side, the panel examined traditional and modern theoretical perspectives, answering the question of whether small states are capable of boosting their defenses and enhancing deterrence by synchronizing their security and improving military interoperability within the collective security system.\nThe 13th ECPR General Conference took place in Wrocław September 4-7, 2019.

Since regaining independence after the illegal Soviet occupation, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all become deeply integrated into Western institutions, such as NATO and the EU. These small countries, understanding the potential peril of reoccupation by a resurgent Russia after the annexation of Crimea, have been extremely vocal in sounding the alarm that Russia remains a security threat. They understand that the West must get serious about security lest its more vulnerable members once more get trampled.\nThirty years ago this month, the Baltic States sent Gorbachev a clear message by forming a massive, 2 million member human chain from Tallinn, Estonia all the way to Vilnius, Lithuania. This show of resolve, known as the Baltic Way, demonstrated that the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian patriots would not be suppressed in their push for independence from Communist tyranny. This large- scale, peaceful popular protest was a remarkable event within the broader miracle of 1989 in Eastern Europe, and has today inspired the people of Hong Kong to make their own “Hong Kong Way.” But, as we in the West celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way, let us not forget the 80th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the danger posed by ambitious neighbors.\nThe Baltic States’ geographic situation is an unfortunate one. They are largely cut off by land from their NATO allies, their terrain has few natural barriers to an invading force, and the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet operates to the Baltic States’ north and south in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. The Suwałki Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland, constitutes the only land border between the Baltic States and the rest of NATO. This tiny strip with two highways lies between Belarus and Kaliningrad, meaning that Russia could easily seal it off, making a logistical nightmare for NATO to come to the Baltics’ aid. At sea, the Russian Navy is not particularly impressive, but is more than capable of harassing ships and conducting grey zone operations on infrastructure and the port and supply chains.\nThis unfortunate geographic situation, combined with Russian military buildup in the Western Military District and Russia’s propensity to meddle in its neighbors’ affairs, makes Baltic Security of vital importance to NATO. As things currently stand, Russia prefers to stay below the threshold of conventional war, knowing that its conventional forces may have a short-term advantage, but that in the long-run, NATO forces are superior. As such, Russia seeks to destabilize the political situation through hybrid means, such as misinformation/disinformation, economic capture, the use of proxy groups as an element of “aktivnye meropriyatiya” (“active measures”) in intelligence operations, and cyber-attacks. By utilizing hybrid warfare against the spectrum of a state’s governmental and societal functions, Russia economizes the use of force and is able to continuously adjust the intensity of conflict. It is important to remember that Russia views itself in conflict with NATO, even though the two are not locked in conventional war.\nAs the situation stands now, Russia is probably unlikely to conduct conventional military operations against the Baltic States. Its economy cannot sustain this kind of war, and it is currently mired in other theaters. Nevertheless, Russia will absolutely continue its hybrid efforts against Baltic society and government, as it seeks to undermine Western influence and restore the Baltic States to its sphere of influence. Indeed, Russia successfully annexed Crimea without firing a shot using a comprehensive package of hybrid tactics, perhaps most famously the “little green men” at a time when it viewed Western leadership as weak and feckless. NATO leadership must remain strong and resolute against the Russian threat, and Western European leaders need to understand that they have a moral imperative to defend their own people as part and parcel of their obligation to NATO. A Russian attack on the Baltic States will inevitably test Article 5 (the principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all”), upon which NATO’s credibility hangs. Likewise, the Baltic States must continue to make strides on societal security, infrastructural security (including energy security), financial security, cyber-security, and defense/deterrence. The work being done in the region is good, and needs to continue in order to maintain freedom in the Baltics.\nFrom the “Year of Terror” in 1941 to re-independence in 1991, the Baltic States suffered under tyranny. For Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, national security is a matter of state survival. Freedom is vulnerable, and must be guarded with vigilance and enthusiasm. Russia must be taken seriously: all too often, the political discourse in the U.S. and Europe recognizes the threat that Russia poses, but fails to understand the nature of Russian tactics. Likewise, many political groups seek to associate their opponents with Russia, while ignoring Russian influence on their own parties, undermining faith in democratic institutions and doing the Russians’ work for them. For NATO, Baltic security is a matter of credibility. If the Baltic States fall and NATO does not respond, the alliance will no longer be taken seriously, and its defense will be undermined. For the United States, it is a matter of both credibility and affinity – the U.S. seeks to defend liberty in the face of tyranny wherever it exists. An aggressive Russia not only threatens security in Europe, but also threatens security in the U.S. After all, Russia seeks to undermine American political stability as well. In geopolitics, everything is interconnected, and the U.S. and Europe cannot afford to neglect any region, especially not the Baltics.\nCover Photo: NATO (nato.int)\n","permalink":"https://balticsecurity.eu/is_baltic_security_important/","tags":["NATO","EU","Transatlantic"],"title":"Is Baltic Security Important for the U.S., NATO, and Europe?
