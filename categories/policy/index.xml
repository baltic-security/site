Over the past two decades, the EU has lost trade share in Latin America to China, whose growing presence in the region—particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, and critical minerals—has shifted the balance of power. Simultaneously, the United States has adopted a more protectionist stance, creating gaps in global trade leadership.</description></item><item><title>Lithuania-Kaliningrad Transit Row: A Broader EU and NATO Perspective</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/lithuania_kaliningrad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/lithuania_kaliningrad/</guid><description>Through much of the end of June, Lithuania has been embroiled in a row with Russia over the implementation of EU sanctions on certain kinds of goods in transit between Russia and its Kaliningrad exclave. Russia has claimed that Lithuania’s actions are a “violation of everything,” and has promised a response that is “not diplomatic.” In turn, Lithuania has argued that it is simply putting into practice the EU sanctions regime agreed upon as early as March, and that contrary to Russian claims, its actions will not halt all transit between Russia and Kaliningrad; rather, it will only stop the flow of sanctioned goods.</description></item><item><title>The Belarusian Migrant Crisis in Broader Geopolitical Context</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/belarusian_migrant_crisis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/belarusian_migrant_crisis/</guid><description>For about the last two months, Lithuania has been in the throes of a migration crisis like it has never seen before. In retaliation to the sanctions placed on his regime following the forced grounding of a passenger airliner to arrest journalist Roman Protasevich, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenka promised to force Europe (and in particular, Lithuania) to deal with drug smuggling and migrant flows on their own. Aside from Lukashenka’s claim to have been stopping migrants and smugglers in the past, the statement gives clear indication of intent to weaponize migration and the flow of contraband.</description></item><item><title>NATO Summit 2021: Broad Goals, Few Specifics</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/nato_summit_2021_broad_goals_few_specifics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/nato_summit_2021_broad_goals_few_specifics/</guid><description>On June 14, heads of state from all NATO members met in Brussels for the 2021 NATO summit. This occurred smack in the middle of U.S. President Biden’s much touted trip to Europe, and overall received little media attention. A Google search of the summit produces primarily NATO press releases, the odd news article here or there (but only from mainstream yet highly partisan sources, fringe outlets, and little else), few analyses, and a preponderance of pre-summit anticipatory articles from news sources and think tanks alike.</description></item><item><title>Securing Energy Supply in the Baltics</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/securing_energy_supply_baltics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/securing_energy_supply_baltics/</guid><description>This month, Lithuania announced the arrival of a 164-tonne transformer as part of the ongoing process for synchronization with the Continental European power grid. This step is considered crucial for successfully exiting the Soviet era BRELL agreement, in which the Baltics’ power grids are controlled by Moscow. Exiting BRELL is a major component of the Baltics’ overall strategy not only for energy security, but for their national security broadly.
Under the BRELL agreement, the Baltics have been synchronously connected to the Integrated Power System/United Power System (IPS/UPS) grid with Russia and Belarus since the end of the Soviet period.</description></item><item><title>U.S. Perspectives on Nord Stream 2</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/perspectives_nord_stream2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/perspectives_nord_stream2/</guid><description>U.S. President Joe Biden has claimed that Nord Stream 2, the controversial Russo-German pipeline project, is a “bad deal for Europe” and has stated his administration’s opposition to the project. At face value, that would appear to be a rare continuity with the previous administration, but a deeper dive into the various perspectives in Washington reveals a much more complicated position. Despite spoken commitments to the bipartisan sanctions regime instituted by the Trump administration, it appears that the Biden administration is ready to wash its hands of the issue and move on.</description></item><item><title>A Contrarian View of Joe Biden and NATO</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/contrarian_view_biden_nato/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/contrarian_view_biden_nato/</guid><description>In the world of analysis, contrarian viewpoints are equally disliked and necessary. They help shape a more robust understanding of the situation at hand and can prepare countries for the otherwise unexpected. As much of Europe celebrates Joe Biden taking the helm in the United States after the much despised Trump administration, it is worthwhile to take a step back and question whether or not that enthusiasm is really merited. As such, this paper puts forth an unabashedly contrarian viewpoint for the sake of an enriched understanding of the world as it may be going forward, lest the Baltics be caught off guard in the broader optimism of their European counterparts.</description></item><item><title>Ukraine-Baltic Energy Cooperation in the Context of Russian Hybrid Aggression</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/ukraine_baltic_energy_cooperation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/ukraine_baltic_energy_cooperation/</guid><description>This article provided by our Ukrainian partners, Ad Astra
Despite being different in so many aspects, Ukraine and the Baltic states have always had a lot of things in common, the main one being a troublesome neighbor on the eastern border that we all have to deal with.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union opened a new era in Russian foreign policy towards the territories that are or were once perceived as a part of the sphere of influence of the former geopolitical empire.</description></item><item><title>U.S.-Poland Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and Why It Matters</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/u.s._poland_edca/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/u.s._poland_edca/</guid><description>On November 9, 2020, 31 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the Polish Senate’s ratification bill of the U.S.-Polish Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). This agreement contains a number of provisions that will facilitate greater defense cooperation between the United States and Poland and improve deterrence and battle readiness for NATO along the alliance’s Eastern Flank. For the Baltics, this ratification is welcome news, as it not only improves the regional deterrent posture, but also a number of crucial conditions in Poland to enable more rapid and effective defense in the event of Russian aggression on their territory.</description></item><item><title>Much Ado About Something: 2% Defense Expenditures and What Really Matters</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/much_ado_about_something/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/much_ado_about_something/</guid><description>In 2014, NATO member states agreed to target defense expenditures of two percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2024. After this commitment, and following Russian aggression in Ukraine, NATO turned the corner on its declining defense expenditures. Facing a new challenge in a revisionist Russia, many allies to the east felt a new sense of urgency about funding their defense, aiming to build a credible deterrent against aggression on their own territory.</description></item><item><title>As Belarus Descends into Turmoil, the West Should Bolster its Readiness</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/as_belarus_descends/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/as_belarus_descends/</guid><description>Belarus seldom registers in the international press during normal times, but while years like 2020 are not so unprecedented, this certainly is not a normal year. Since President Aleksandr Lukashenko was declared the winner of the fraudulent presidential elections on August 9, the country has spiraled into civil unrest and authoritarian repression, and the headlines keep coming like a stampede. While no one was surprised by the announced outcome of the election, most analysts would not have predicted that Belarus would be launched headlong into a persistent crisis.</description></item><item><title>The Future of Belarus?</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/the_future_of_belarus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/the_future_of_belarus/</guid><description>The Belarusian elections occurred last Sunday, August 9th, and pitted incumbent president Alexander Lukashenko against political outsider Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. For what was supposed to be another easy campaign in Lukashenko’s winning streak, the protests leading up, and following the elections have sparked internal turmoil in Belarus.
The Belarusian government now faces its biggest crisis in 26 years, as protests and police violence sweep the capital and the opposition increases their demands.</description></item><item><title>Moving the Front Lines: Could Recent Moves in Europe Signal an Adjustment of U.S. Focus Eastward?</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/moving_the_front_lines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/moving_the_front_lines/</guid><description>In June the Trump administration announced its decision to pull 9,500 U.S. troops from Germany. The move was lambasted by those on the left and right alike, and indeed, at face value, it appeared counterintuitive. Any return to the Obama and Bush-era troop drawdown in Europe would be foolish facing a revisionist Russia. But if there is anything the keen and impartial observer should know by now about this administration, it is that it keeps its cards close to the chest, absorbing the criticism that inevitably comes and only revealing its end game down the line.</description></item><item><title>The Three Seas Initiative</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/three_seas_initiative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/three_seas_initiative/</guid><description>Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would commit up to $1 Billion in support for the Three Seas Initiative. In so doing, Congress and the administration are providing much needed assistance toward developing the economic and security infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. This initiative, launched in 2015 by the Polish and Croatian presidents, aims to make Central Europe a “backbone of European resilience,” in the words of Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.</description></item><item><title>Belarus: An Overlooked Key to Baltic Security</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/belarus_an_overlooked_key/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/belarus_an_overlooked_key/</guid><description>Winston Churchill once famously quipped that “Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma”. A keen observer will notice that Alyaksandar Lukashenka’s Belarus is much the same. All too often, Western analysts have made the mistake of grossly oversimplifying Belarus’ relationship with Russia, as well as its domestic political affairs and broader foreign policy. This has led the West to neglect relations with Minsk, where despite a less than ideal government, great strategic opportunity lies, and where there is also significant strategic risk.</description></item><item><title>Why Stopping Nord Stream 2 Matters for the Baltics</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/stopping_nord_stream/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/stopping_nord_stream/</guid><description>Nord Stream 2 is a Russian gas pipeline project running mostly parallel to the current Nord Stream pipeline from Vyborg to Greifswald, Germany. This second line would allow for additional gas flows directly from Russia to Western Europe up to a potential 110 billion cubic meters annually. At face value, this expansion is an economic opportunity that makes sense for Germany and other potential Western European customers. In a perfect world, it would be just that.</description></item><item><title>Is Baltic Security Important for the U.S., NATO, and Europe? Absolutely!</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/is_baltic_security_important/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/is_baltic_security_important/</guid><description>The three Baltic States are key members of the NATO defensive alliance. Since regaining independence after the illegal Soviet occupation, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all become deeply integrated into Western institutions, such as NATO and the EU. These small countries, understanding the potential peril of reoccupation by a resurgent Russia after the annexation of Crimea, have been extremely vocal in sounding the alarm that Russia remains a security threat. They understand that the West must get serious about security lest its more vulnerable members once more get trampled.</description></item></channel></rss>
