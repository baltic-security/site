                <div id="post-content">
                  <p>The three Baltic States are key members of the NATO defensive alliance. Since regaining independence after the illegal Soviet occupation, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all become deeply integrated into Western institutions, such as NATO and the EU. These small countries, understanding the potential peril
of reoccupation by a resurgent Russia after the annexation of Crimea, have been extremely vocal in
sounding the alarm that Russia remains a security threat. They understand that the West must get serious
about security lest its more vulnerable members once more get trampled.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago this month, the Baltic States sent Gorbachev a clear message by forming a
massive, 2 million member human chain from Tallinn, Estonia all the way to Vilnius, Lithuania. This
show of resolve, known as the Baltic Way, demonstrated that the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian
patriots would not be suppressed in their push for independence from Communist tyranny. This large-
scale, peaceful popular protest was a remarkable event within the broader miracle of 1989 in Eastern
Europe, and has today inspired the people of Hong Kong to make their own “Hong Kong Way.” But, as
we in the West celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Baltic Way, let us not forget the 80th anniversary of
the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the danger posed by ambitious neighbors.</p>
<p>The Baltic States’ geographic situation is an unfortunate one. They are largely cut off by land
from their NATO allies, their terrain has few natural barriers to an invading force, and the Russian Baltic
Sea Fleet operates to the Baltic States’ north and south in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. The Suwałki
Gap, a narrow strip of land on the border of Lithuania and Poland, constitutes the only land border
between the Baltic States and the rest of NATO. This tiny strip with two highways lies between Belarus
and Kaliningrad, meaning that Russia could easily seal it off, making a logistical nightmare for NATO to
come to the Baltics’ aid. At sea, the Russian Navy is not particularly impressive, but is more than capable
of harassing ships and conducting grey zone operations on infrastructure and the port and supply chains.</p>
<p>This unfortunate geographic situation, combined with Russian military buildup in the Western Military
District and Russia’s propensity to meddle in its neighbors’ affairs, makes Baltic Security of vital
importance to NATO. As things currently stand, Russia prefers to stay below the threshold of
conventional war, knowing that its conventional forces may have a short-term advantage, but that in the
long-run, NATO forces are superior. As such, Russia seeks to destabilize the political situation through
hybrid means, such as misinformation/disinformation, economic capture, the use of proxy groups as an
element of “aktivnye meropriyatiya” (“active measures”) in intelligence operations, and cyber-attacks. By
utilizing hybrid warfare against the spectrum of a state’s governmental and societal functions, Russia
economizes the use of force and is able to continuously adjust the intensity of conflict. It is important to
remember that Russia views itself in conflict with NATO, even though the two are not locked in
conventional war.</p>
<p>As the situation stands now, Russia is probably unlikely to conduct conventional military
operations against the Baltic States. Its economy cannot sustain this kind of war, and it is currently mired
in other theaters. Nevertheless, Russia will absolutely continue its hybrid efforts against Baltic society and
government, as it seeks to undermine Western influence and restore the Baltic States to its sphere of
influence. Indeed, Russia successfully annexed Crimea without firing a shot using a comprehensive
package of hybrid tactics, perhaps most famously the “little green men” at a time when it viewed Western
leadership as weak and feckless. NATO leadership must remain strong and resolute against the Russian
threat, and Western European leaders need to understand that they have a moral imperative to defend their
own people as part and parcel of their obligation to NATO. A Russian attack on the Baltic States will
inevitably test Article 5 (the principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all”), upon which NATO’s
credibility hangs. Likewise, the Baltic States must continue to make strides on societal security,
infrastructural security (including energy security), financial security, cyber-security, and
defense/deterrence. The work being done in the region is good, and needs to continue in order to maintain
freedom in the Baltics.</p>
<p>From the “Year of Terror” in 1941 to re-independence in 1991, the Baltic States suffered under
tyranny. For Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, national security is a matter of state survival. Freedom is
vulnerable, and must be guarded with vigilance and enthusiasm. Russia must be taken seriously: all too
often, the political discourse in the U.S. and Europe recognizes the threat that Russia poses, but fails to
understand the nature of Russian tactics. Likewise, many political groups seek to associate their
opponents with Russia, while ignoring Russian influence on their own parties, undermining faith in
democratic institutions and doing the Russians’ work for them. For NATO, Baltic security is a matter of
credibility. If the Baltic States fall and NATO does not respond, the alliance will no longer be taken
seriously, and its defense will be undermined. For the United States, it is a matter of both credibility and
affinity – the U.S. seeks to defend liberty in the face of tyranny wherever it exists. An aggressive Russia
not only threatens security in Europe, but also threatens security in the U.S. After all, Russia seeks to
undermine American political stability as well. In geopolitics, everything is interconnected, and the U.S.
and Europe cannot afford to neglect any region, especially not the Baltics.</p>
