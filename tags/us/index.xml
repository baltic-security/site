The Euroatlantic states sharing the Baltic Sea have been subject to persistent security threats that have made them seek international solutions to maintain peace and stability. Challenges associated with Russia have been at the forefront for decades and are so today with its war against Ukraine. Meanwhile over the last decade the regional presence of China has increased - welcomed by many but analyzed by few.</description></item><item><title>Transatlantic Security Exchange</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/transatlantic_security_exchange/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/transatlantic_security_exchange/</guid><description>The Baltic Security Foundation has launched the Transatlantic Security Exchange.

This agreement contains a number of provisions that will facilitate greater defense cooperation between the United States and Poland and improve deterrence and battle readiness for NATO along the alliance’s Eastern Flank. For the Baltics, this ratification is welcome news, as it not only improves the regional deterrent posture, but also a number of crucial conditions in Poland to enable more rapid and effective defense in the event of Russian aggression on their territory.</description></item><item><title>Javelin Deliveries and the Prospects of Tank Warfare in the Baltics</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/tank_warfare_baltics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/tank_warfare_baltics/</guid><description>At the beginning of this month, the U.S. delivered 128 javelin anti-tank missiles to Estonia, part of ongoing cooperation between the two countries. This will provide another moderate boost to the credibility of Estonia’s deterrent posture. These kinds of smaller procurements are an important part of the broader effort to build up a credible defense in case of Russian aggression and to signal that the risk outweighs the reward for attacking the Baltic States.</description></item><item><title>The Three Seas Initiative</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/three_seas_initiative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/three_seas_initiative/</guid><description>Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would commit up to $1 Billion in support for the Three Seas Initiative.
