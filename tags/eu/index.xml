Over the past two decades, the EU has lost trade share in Latin America to China, whose growing presence in the region—particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, and critical minerals—has shifted the balance of power. Simultaneously, the United States has adopted a more protectionist stance, creating gaps in global trade leadership.</description></item><item><title>Transatlantic response to China</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/transatlantic_response_to_china/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/transatlantic_response_to_china/</guid><description>Roger W.

The Euroatlantic states sharing the Baltic Sea have been subject to persistent security threats that have made them seek international solutions to maintain peace and stability. Challenges associated with Russia have been at the forefront for decades and are so today with its war against Ukraine. Meanwhile over the last decade the regional presence of China has increased - welcomed by many but analyzed by few.</description></item><item><title>Lithuania-Kaliningrad Transit Row: A Broader EU and NATO Perspective</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/lithuania_kaliningrad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/lithuania_kaliningrad/</guid><description>Through much of the end of June, Lithuania has been embroiled in a row with Russia over the implementation of EU sanctions on certain kinds of goods in transit between Russia and its Kaliningrad exclave. Russia has claimed that Lithuania’s actions are a “violation of everything,” and has promised a response that is “not diplomatic.” In turn, Lithuania has argued that it is simply putting into practice the EU sanctions regime agreed upon as early as March, and that contrary to Russian claims, its actions will not halt all transit between Russia and Kaliningrad; rather, it will only stop the flow of sanctioned goods.</description></item><item><title>Baltic Cyber Resilience Report Published</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/baltic-cyber-resilience-report/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/baltic-cyber-resilience-report/</guid><description>Baltic Security Foundation is proud to announce the publication of the Baltic Cyber Resilience Report.

In retaliation to the sanctions placed on his regime following the forced grounding of a passenger airliner to arrest journalist Roman Protasevich, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenka promised to force Europe (and in particular, Lithuania) to deal with drug smuggling and migrant flows on their own. Aside from Lukashenka’s claim to have been stopping migrants and smugglers in the past, the statement gives clear indication of intent to weaponize migration and the flow of contraband.</description></item><item><title>The Future of Belarus?</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/the_future_of_belarus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/the_future_of_belarus/</guid><description>The Belarusian elections occurred last Sunday, August 9th, and pitted incumbent president Alexander Lukashenko against political outsider Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. For what was supposed to be another easy campaign in Lukashenko’s winning streak, the protests leading up, and following the elections have sparked internal turmoil in Belarus.
The Belarusian government now faces its biggest crisis in 26 years, as protests and police violence sweep the capital and the opposition increases their demands.</description></item><item><title>The Three Seas Initiative</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/three_seas_initiative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/three_seas_initiative/</guid><description>Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the United States would commit up to $1 Billion in support for the Three Seas Initiative. In so doing, Congress and the administration are providing much needed assistance toward developing the economic and security infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe. This initiative, launched in 2015 by the Polish and Croatian presidents, aims to make Central Europe a “backbone of European resilience,” in the words of Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.</description></item><item><title>Defending the Suwałki Gap</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/defending_suwalki_gap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/defending_suwalki_gap/</guid><description>At the end of last month, Lithuania and Poland announced that the two countries would each assign a brigade to NATO Headquarters in Poland to “train and act together” for the defense of the Suwałki Gap. According to the signed act of affiliation, Lithuania’s Iron Wolf Mechanized Brigade and Poland’s 15th Mechanized Brigade will train jointly to prepare for operations in the Gap, though they will remain under their own national command.</description></item><item><title>Baltic Fund</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/baltic_fund/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/baltic_fund/</guid><description>On November 28, 2019, Baltic Security Foundation team participated in the NATO Eastern Flank Security conference, hosted by Warsaw Institute.

A keen observer will notice that Alyaksandar Lukashenka’s Belarus is much the same. All too often, Western analysts have made the mistake of grossly oversimplifying Belarus’ relationship with Russia, as well as its domestic political affairs and broader foreign policy. This has led the West to neglect relations with Minsk, where despite a less than ideal government, great strategic opportunity lies, and where there is also significant strategic risk.</description></item><item><title>Regional Activities 2019</title><link>https://balticsecurity.eu/regional_activities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://balticsecurity.eu/regional_activities/</guid><description>October 2019 has been busy for the Baltic Security Foundation, pursuing our goal of fostering and promoting Baltic defense and security.

Since regaining independence after the illegal Soviet occupation, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have all become deeply integrated into Western institutions, such as NATO and the EU. These small countries, understanding the potential peril of reoccupation by a resurgent Russia after the annexation of Crimea, have been extremely vocal in sounding the alarm that Russia remains a security threat. They understand that the West must get serious about security lest its more vulnerable members once more get trampled.</description></item></channel></rss>
